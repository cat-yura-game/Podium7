## Disabled-AKS removes the first lock; platform SecureRoot now blocks

Run 38091845866 (74e05ae) validates the explicit disabled-AKS manager alias:
original AppleSEPManager registers; init_data_protection prints No SEP present;
all 22 early tasks complete without panic, with 100,707 EL0 returns in 300s.
keybagd no longer waits on the owner's SEP manager lock: it has ordinary Mach
receive/workqueue continuations. 59 processes remain; neither SpringBoard nor
backboardd appears. This is real removal of one wait, not a completed boot.

containermanager PID 67 now returns through 0xfffffff00664be98 and
0xfffffff005b92a28. The latter address is in the original AppleARMPlatform
__TEXT_EXEC (0xfffffff005b88000 +0x33f70), not an AKS initialization function.
Original strings and dispatch code identify SecureRoot; the platform waits for
its +0x10a completion byte. The earlier IOSecureBSDRoot RET diagnostic omitted
the SecureRootName callback, leaving this request permanently incomplete.

A separate disabled-aks-root-unsupported probe adds a full-original-hash and
20-byte signature guarded SecureRoot query failure path. It zeros the original
one-byte output when non-null, returns kIOReturnUnsupported (0xe00002c7), and
uses the original shared epilogue. It does not set authentication or readiness
flags, release a lock manually, or return success. Default/earlier experiments
are unchanged and reproducible. 147 host tests pass; the patch was also applied
locally to the exact original image, preserving its length and recording all
edits and hashes. Real consumer behavior still requires a new full guest test.

The separate read-only provisioning analysis 38092124020 now succeeds after
fixing bounded APFS readiness and userland LC_MAIN parsing; no original binary,
shared cache or key values were exported.

## Explicit disabled-AKS manager experiment

Original AppleSEPKeyStore code at 0xfffffff00664b8b8 reads aks-endpoint as an
8-byte boot argument and sets object +0x1bc when it is explicitly zero.
The availability function 0xfffffff006653ad4 first waits for AppleSEPManager,
then returns false when +0x1bc is set; getSEPEndpoint returns without waiting
for a crypto endpoint. Supplying aks-endpoint=0 alone with an omitted manager
cannot resolve the confirmed owner wait, because that wait precedes the flag.

A separate opt-in disabled-aks mode keeps the passive original-compatible
manager under /arm-io/sep-research-manager and supplies the original zero
endpoint argument. The original /arm-io/sep path remains absent so the boot
tool can take its existing no-SEP branch. This is an explicit virtual platform
experiment, not the hardware identity or security behavior of a real iPod.
Default flags/tree are unchanged; reports identify the alias and keep SEP
firmware execution, data protection and visible desktop unconfirmed. No
successful crypto response, dummy Gigalocker or boot-task patch is added.
144 host tests pass; real driver matching and both desktop processes require
runtime validation before this experiment can be considered useful.

## Retained SEP node reproduces original Gigalocker boot failure

Run 38090798038 (27f0f0f) confirms AppleSEPManager registration and
AppleCredentialManager matching with the transport-probe node retained.
Despite boot-ios-diagnostics=1 being present in the prepared DeviceTree,
init_data_protection takes its original SEP branch: the Gigalocker file is
absent, exit(2) causes a userspace boot-task panic. Keybag diagnostic skip was
not reached. 12,120 EL0 returns are observed; only fsck, mount-phase-1 and
data-protection execute. Neither desktop process exists. This experiment
therefore does not resolve the original launch stall and is not promoted to
the default profile.

The next read-only inspection (38091381112) decodes five bounded windows in
the exact original init_data_protection image to determine its real argument
and Gigalocker creation path. No empty/fabricated Gigalocker, launch-task skip,
security response or cryptographic material is introduced. The boot verifier
now reports both actual SpringBoard/backboardd process identities as a distinct
milestone, independently of launch labels or visible-display confirmation.

## Actual lock owner waits for absent AppleSEPManager

Run 38090369482 (217a36c), after 300 seconds, records 59 actual processes,
with neither SpringBoard nor backboardd. Both keybagd PID 47 / TID 698 and
containermanager PID 67 / TID 718 wait for the same workloop owner TID 138.
The owner's original stack returns through 0xfffffff006653c38: the preceding
call passes timeout -1 to waitForService for AppleSEPManager. This precisely
confirms the missing-service dependency of the no-SEP-node diagnostic profile.
It is not a guest credential, JIT or launch-label failure.

The first owner diagnostic (38089499560) read the wrong frame's saved x19;
217a36c uses the preceding contended-lock frame, verified against original
prologue 0xfffffff0072e3570/74 and a realistic nested-frame unit fixture.
The corrected real snapshot reports the same owner stack for both waiters.
No mutex was released, and no SEP or keybag response was fabricated.

Control run 38090021863 retains the original SEP node without the no-SEP/keybag
profile. It reaches data-protection but exits 2 on the absent original
/private/xarts/*.gl Gigalocker, then panics on that boot task. This is not a
working original-SEP boot. The new opt-in transport probe retains the original
T8010 SEP node while preserving the explicit research keybag diagnostic handoff,
to observe the real driver dependency independently of this earlier boot task.
Defaults are unchanged. SEP firmware execution and protection remain absent;
a retained device node is not an implemented SEP. Run 38090798038 exercises
that transport probe; its outcome must be inspected before claiming progress.
139 host tests pass, including rejection of incomplete transport profiles.

## Confirmed Sandbox / AppleSEPKeyStore wait chain

Run 38088477867 (182905f) records the same 16 kernel return addresses in all
22 xpcproxy threads and one root launchd worker. The original sandbox kext's
0xfffffff0069406bc path obtains host special port 25, then calls kernel Mach
RPC at 0xfffffff0069408e4. The stub resolves to original
_mach_msg_rpc_from_kernel_proper (0xfffffff0071cc7b0). Port 25 is
HOST_CONTAINERD_PORT in Apple's host_special_ports.h. The surrounding path
updates process sandbox/container credentials during exec. This is an actual
wait chain, not an inference from PID ordering or missing argv pages.

containermanagerd PID 67 and keybagd PID 47 both block at the same original
AppleSEPKeyStore user-client path 0xfffffff00665734c, through
IOCommandGate::runAction and IOWorkLoop::closeGate (return 0xfffffff007764520).
Their state is 9 and they wait in the contended mutex path. The next bounded
reader identifies the thread holding that workloop lock without releasing it
or substituting a successful SEP response. The SEP initialization/hardware
dependency has not been resolved; SpringBoard/backboardd remain absent.

The read-only prelink metadata and each embedded kext's Mach-O segments verify
the two address ranges: sandbox __TEXT_EXEC 0xfffffff00691c000..006942e28;
AppleSEPKeyStore __TEXT_EXEC 0xfffffff006646000..006677f0c. Do not attribute
these stripped functions using the nearest unrelated global kernel symbol.

Run 38088131684 validates the bounded label reader's failure behavior:
all 22 proxy argument pages are unmapped at this snapshot. No labels were
recovered or guessed, and verified process/thread identities remain intact.
137 tests pass in the stack snapshot run. Visible desktop is unconfirmed.

Primary port definition:
https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/main/osfmk/mach/host_special_ports.h

## Bounded diagnostics for the outstanding launch stall

The stopped, hash-gated process snapshot now records original thread IDs,
scheduler state integers and kernel continuation addresses. Original task_hold
code at 0xfffffff0071fb1b4/21c walks task +0x58 and thread +0x3a8;
_thread_tid at 0xfffffff00720aa00 returns +0x458; the common thread_block path
at 0xfffffff0071ea608 stores continuation +0xd0 and checks state +0x198.
Queue cycles and per-task/global size limits are enforced. A failed thread
read does not discard the verified process identity. These fields reveal wait
primitives, not proof that a service has finished initialization.

A separate reader can retain only xpcproxy's launch label present in the
original launch metadata. It follows the original 16-KiB pmap geometry,
restricts physical reads to the research machine's DRAM, and stops after argv1.
Original sysctl procargs2 at 0xfffffff0075ed578 identifies argslen +0x340,
argc +0x344 and user_stack +0x348. No argument/environment bytes, user stack
dumps or binaries are exported. The expected xpcproxy layout is checked rather
than searching arbitrary user memory. 135 host tests pass; real guest validation
is required before treating recovered labels as evidence.

## Original SpringBoard launch restriction and missing environment handoff

Read-only run 38084032951 scans 425 original launch plists. SpringBoard and
backboardd both request RunAtLoad/KeepAlive as mobile. SpringBoard additionally
has LimitLoadFromHardware={osenvironment:[diagnostics]}; backboardd has no such
restriction. The original /chosen/osenvironment handoff is a 32-byte zero placeholder.
These are facts, not proof that the current environment is diagnostics.

Original 19H422 code at 0xfffffff00780fb44 reads /chosen/osenvironment and calls
sysctl_set_osenvironment at 0xfffffff0076007c8 only when the property exists.
Apple's public bsd/kern/kern_mib.c confirms hw.osenvironment returns EINVAL
without a supplied value. The next experiment supplies normal only when that
handoff is absent/zero, independently of product/boot-ios-diagnostics; original
nonempty values and launch plists remain unchanged. SEP/authenticated boot and
SpringBoard remain unconfirmed. Run 38084762951 validates the handoff for 600
seconds without panic, but still has 59 processes and no SpringBoard/backboardd
(104,612 EL0 returns). Control run 38084396370 also has 59 processes and no
desktop after 600 seconds (103,651 returns). Normal environment did not resolve
the launch stall. Both retain 22 xpcproxy processes parented by launchd. The
next diagnostic records bounded effective UID metadata and original launch
service users to investigate where these proxies wait before exec.

Run 38086369069 confirms that UID collection works in the original guest:
59 processes, 100,232 EL0 returns in 300 seconds, no panic. Mobile launchd and
many original services run as UID 501. Of the 22 remaining xpcproxy processes,
12 have UID 501, nine have UID 0, and one has UID 25. All have parent PID 1.
Thus a general failure to resolve/switch to mobile credentials is ruled out.
The snapshot still has no SpringBoard/backboardd. Proxy target identities and
their exact wait conditions have not yet been established; do not infer them
from PID order. 128 tests pass locally and in the macOS workflow.

UID offsets were recovered from original _proc_ucred 0xfffffff0075dbca8
(proc +0x20 -> proc_ro, validates proc_ro +0 back-reference, credential +0x20)
and _kauth_cred_getuid 0xfffffff0075abadc (credential +0x18). Reads retain only
UID/PID/PPID/name and remain gated by the original kernel SHA-256.

The analysis script also fixes an observed macOS APFS publication race with
bounded retries and strict System UUID checks. 127 local tests pass. The macOS
probe test now resolves /var versus /private/var before mocking fixture size.

## Process snapshot diagnostic repair

Run 38068590109 executed the original guest for 300 seconds but its host probe
failed at snapshot collection: a later function-local hashlib import shadowed
the module import, raising UnboundLocalError. Its serial still records early
boot completion without kernel panic. It produced no process snapshot; do not
interpret that missing evidence as a guest boot regression.

Commit 0667361 removes the shadowing import. A deadline integration test now
exercises the complete host snapshot-and-termination path and verifies the
kernel layout hash check. QMP tests also verify rounded PID reads and ensure
raw memory words are not retained. 122 local tests pass. Run 38081478064 is the
real guest validation of that correction and completed successfully. Its bounded
snapshot contains 59 processes, including runningboardd, mediaserverd, configd
and keybagd, but neither SpringBoard nor backboardd. There were 100,747 EL0
returns and no panic during 300 seconds. This confirms system services, not
the desktop. Next investigation reads original graphics service launch conditions
from the immutable System fixture; no launch configuration is fabricated.

The read-only process layout was independently resolved in the original kernel:
_proc_find 0xfffffff0075d9f18 uses hash pointer 0xfffffff007137440 and mask
0xfffffff007137448, PID +0x68 and hash link +0xa8. _proc_name at
0xfffffff0075db80c copies the process name from +0x370. Layout use is gated by
the exact original kernel SHA-256, and corrupt/cyclic/oversized lists are
rejected. A process named SpringBoard alone does not prove visible desktop.

## CPU UVLO panic resolved in real boot; SpringBoard remains open

Run 38067643433 on f7dc7d3 completes 300 seconds without kernel panic, missing
APFS roles, launchd boot-task failure or trace-budget exhaustion. All 22 original
early-boot tasks complete; keybag diagnostic skip and `Early boot complete` are
confirmed. There are 99,599 EL0 returns. The separate ARM64 guest PMGR checks
pass for all seven E/P records, maximum and intermediate P-state transitions,
and invalid requests. No original PMGR assertion was patched out.

This confirms the previous CPU UVLO panic is resolved in this diagnostic run.
It does not establish SpringBoard, display scanout, SEP protection or authenticated
boot. Serial after early boot primarily contains thermal sensor-off warnings.
A bounded read-only process metadata snapshot is being added to identify which
original system services are running, independently of serial verbosity.
Only PID/name metadata is retained; raw process memory is not exported.
The recovered display timing ABI is documented in DISPLAY_BRINGUP.md.

---

## Original early boot completes; CPU UVLO transition blocks full boot

Run 38065904495 confirms the original keybag diagnostic path and all 22
original launchd early-boot tasks. The serial log reports `Early boot complete.
Continuing system boot.` with 26,608 EL0 returns. SpringBoard is not confirmed.
The next genuine kernel panic is AppleT8010PMGR setPerfStateCPU line 742:
`_uvloMidPCPUPerfState != state`. SEP protection remains unimplemented;
ephemeral storage is disabled and the disk remains fixed at 16 GiB.

Static analysis shows the old four-state virtual table omitted the original
1056-MHz intermediate P state selected by the UVLO search. The handoff now
preserves all three E and four P frequencies from the original DeviceTree.
The virtual PMGR classifies the corresponding seven hardware records and
rejects requests outside that table. Guest MMIO checks cover highest and
intermediate transitions before the next full-system boot. The kernel assert
is unchanged. Runtime validation of this correction is pending.

---

## Keybag diagnostic handoff experiment (not yet boot-confirmed)

Read-only inspection 38065058205 confirms both diagnostic and ephemeral skip
messages in original keybagd. It exported only bounded analysis/metadata after
explicit user authorization, never original executables or shared caches.
Reference decoding now handles linker-relaxed ADR and C-string log prefixes.

Primary qemu-t8030 code supplies product/boot-ios-diagnostics=1; debug=0x14e
alone was ineffective in our exact firmware. An independent opt-in handoff now
supplies that one 32-bit property on verified T8010, requiring the existing
no-SEP/FastSim/unsealed experiment. Persistent 16-GiB disk and original keybagd
remain unchanged; ephemeral-storage is not enabled. Reports distinguish the
handoff being supplied from its effect in the actual guest. SEP data protection
and SpringBoard remain unconfirmed until real runtime evidence.

Reference: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrungNguyen1909/qemu-t8030/master/hw/arm/xnu.c
114 local tests pass, including default preservation, corrupt handoff rejection,
linker-relaxed string references and symbol-stub bounds.

---

## Mount-phase-2 and FIPS pass; original keybag task waits

Run 38061956311 completes the full 300-second experiment without panic,
DMA rejection or trace-budget exhaustion. Original launchd reaches eleven
boot tasks through keybag; filesystem checking and both mount phases pass.
All twenty original Apple corecrypto FIPS self-tests pass. Hardware factory
cache exists in System and is empty; its original empty structure was copied.
15,482 genuine EL0 returns are observed. System userland gate passes, but
Early boot complete and SpringBoard are NOT confirmed. The last task is
keybag; the kernel snapshot shows a wait path, not a crash.

Run 38063364985 tested the explicit debug=0x14e profile. It does NOT skip
keybag initialization in this exact firmware: 15,605 genuine EL0 returns,
no panic, but no diagnostic skip and no early boot completion after 300 seconds.
Default boot arguments remain unchanged. No SEP/keybag support is claimed.

A read-only host inspection now locates original keybag diagnostic conditions
in selected executables and the shared cache. It records bounded decoded branch
windows and metadata only; no original executable or cache is exported.
The source disk is attached and mounted read-only, with System UUID validation.
This is static analysis, not another successful boot claim.
Original boot-tool metadata (name, size and SHA-256) is recorded without exporting executables.
106 local tests pass. Full boot and protected storage remain open gates.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38061956311

---

## Original no-SEP path advances to mount-phase-2

Run 38061424058 executes 14,311 genuine EL0 returns. The original boot task
reports No SEP present, then completes finish-obliteration and commit-boot-mode.
Original mount mounts Data at /private/var, Update and Hardware. FastSim/no-SEP
remain explicitly unauthenticated diagnostics, without SEP data protection.

The next observed failure is mount-phase-2 exit 66: the Hardware volume lacks
FactoryData/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.factorydata, required as the source
of a bind mount into System. Preparation now creates that real directory and
copies original System factory-cache contents when present. Empty directory
creation does not invent factory keys or establish device personalization.
The result records source availability, file count and unconfirmed factory
personalization. Guest mount must validate the next stage. No SpringBoard yet.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38061424058

---

## FastSim identity alone does not skip SEP

Run 38060545190 confirms FastSim is enabled in original APFS and repeats
clean filesystem checking and successful xART/Preboot mounting. However,
data-protection still exits 2 on missing Gigalocker: the original SEP node
continues to publish AppleSEPManager. FastSim alone is not a fix.

Next explicit no-SEP platform experiment omits only the verified T8010 SEP
subtree, while preserving PMP, other devices, original binaries, fstab and
kernel checks. It requires both FastSim and unsealed APFS diagnostic flags;
normal configuration remains unchanged. Reports explicitly mark the omitted
hardware and unimplemented SEP protection. 105 local tests pass. The guest
must demonstrate its own no-SEP branch and subsequent boot tasks before any
progress beyond data-protection can be claimed.

---

## Mount-phase-1 passes; next task needs SEP-backed Gigalocker

Run 38059471628 genuinely checks all six APFS volume superblocks and prints
QUICKCHECK ONLY; FILESYSTEM CLEAN. Original mount discovers Data at disk0s1s4,
mounts xART read-write and Preboot read-only, then launchd advances to
data-protection. The previous missing-role / mount-phase-1 exit 66 is fixed.
The run executes 12,179 genuine EL0 returns. It now panics because the xART
Gigalocker file is absent: data-protection exits 2. No SpringBoard yet.

Next experiment explicitly supplies a FastSim product identity in the
research handoff, following the original qemu-t8030 research implementation:
https://github.com/TrungNguyen1909/qemu-t8030/blob/master/hw/arm/t8030.c
This selects Apple's simulator-style no-SEP path; it does not implement SEP,
protect user data, establish authenticated boot, or replace system binaries.
Default device identity remains unchanged. CLI requires an explicit unsealed
APFS experiment and verifies the original T8010 tree. Hardware nodes stay
intact, and the report records FastSim and unconfirmed SEP data protection.
104 local tests pass; the real guest result remains to be measured.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38059471628

---

## Real install roles under guest validation

Run 38057428910 confirms native APFS expansion to the fixed 16-GiB disk:
container capacity 17,179,832,320 bytes. GPT now exposes the actual final
usable LBA; both header and entry-table checksums are checked before edits.
The original System UUID is preserved and guest filesystem checking passes.

The original DeviceTree fstab requires xART, System, Preboot, Data, Update
and Hardware. Guest APFS aborts fstab enumeration on the missing xART role,
so adding Preboot alone cannot complete mount-phase-1. Native macOS refuses
both direct xART creation and assigning its iOS role to a new empty volume
(run 38058108440, error -69599).

The next isolated experiment creates genuine empty APFS filesystems with
native diskutil, copies original Data/Preboot files, detaches the entire
image, then formats only the four new volume role fields using Apple's
published APFS schema. UUID, name, encryption state, object type, checksum
and absence of an existing role/group must match before any write. System
and Preboot metadata remain unchanged. Historical superblocks are checked
and their checksums updated; original guest fsck and mounts must validate
this experiment. All 101 local tests pass, including corruption rejection
before writes and preservation of System and unrelated metadata.

This does not establish an authenticated restore, System/Data grouping,
a valid root snapshot, a display, or SpringBoard. These remain open gates.

---

## Preboot allocation works; next guest mount task under test

Run 38055238180 confirms the source APFS container permits 14 volumes and
native diskutil successfully creates Preboot. Creating xART fails with
-69624. Earlier runs show grouped Data creation also failing. Removing the
read-only source mount before allocation did not resolve grouped Data.

Original guest mount in run 38053476211 explicitly reports missing Data
as not required in environment 1, then exits 66 on the missing Preboot
firmware path. The next isolated experiment therefore requires real Preboot,
records any grouped Data creation failure, and does not create xART on the
host. It verifies that failed Data allocation did not partially create a
volume. Missing optional roles are reported, never claimed as prepared.

Run 38055578574 tests the actual guest mount phase with that layout.
96 local tests pass. SpringBoard and authenticated boot remain unconfirmed.

---

## System userland proceeds to mount-phase-1; installed volumes missing

Run 38053476211 executes 10,497 EL0 returns and passes the real fsck quick
check. launchd then starts mount-phase-1. Original mount reports a missing
Data volume, missing role 256 (xART), and ENOENT for the Preboot firmware
namespace before exit 66. launchd requests a userspace panic. This is the
next concrete failure, rather than a filesystem-check hang.

The isolated install-layout experiment creates role-tagged Data, Preboot
and xART volumes using Apple diskutil, groups Data with the exact original
System UUID, and seeds available original /private/var and firmware files.
Mount paths are verified against the attached fixture before copying.
The currently synthetic handoff selects an all-zero boot-manifest namespace;
this is recorded explicitly. It does not establish authenticated boot, an
installed root snapshot, display support, or a running SpringBoard.

Run 38054266282 tests this layout with the original guest mount task. The
source disk artifact is preserved; only its downloaded copy is changed.
95 local tests pass, including rejecting host containers and wrong mounts.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38053476211

---

## Real system launchd reached in explicit unsealed-root diagnostic

Run 38051230231 executes original system launchd from the APFS System volume
and records 9,813 returns to EL0, without a kernel panic. This is system
userland, not the restore environment. SpringBoard is not confirmed. This
optional exact-kernel diagnostic is unauthenticated; strict-root defaults
remain unchanged.

The serial log reports QUICKCHECK ONLY; FILESYSTEM CLEAN. The harness then
stopped at its 16 MiB trace cap after 69 seconds, despite a 300-second budget.
This is not evidence of a filesystem hang. Full-system tests now explicitly
allow a bounded 128 MiB trace, keeping the 16 MiB bootstrap default and
recording the selected limit. The next test must establish further progress.

Host snapshot attempts failed with EPERM, ad-hoc entitlement rejection, or
missing Preboot for bless. No authenticated installed image was produced.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38051230231

## System volume found; official auth blob accepted; named snapshot missing

Run38047075315 confirms original iOS creates disk0s1s1 and mounts
SkyUpdate19H422.N112OS after the internal-storage DeviceTree correction.
It then panics because /chosen/system-volume-auth-blob is missing.

Run38047922400 supplies the unchanged208-byte SystemVolume isys payload
from Firmware/098-68748-067.dmg.root_hash; container SHA384 matches Apple's
BuildManifest. Original APFS imports it without the missing-blob error.
The next failure is apfs_find_named_root_snapshot_xid returning ENOENT,
followed by rootvp not authenticated after mounting. System launchd, EL0
and SpringBoard remain unconfirmed; original APFS authentication is intact.
The bootloader handoff and previously documented research patches remain
synthetic, not an authenticated iBoot chain.

APFS builds the expected name from com.apple.os.update- and the32-byte
primary hash at payload offset16. Run38048484989 inspects volume roles and
snapshots through a read-only, unmounted macOS attachment of the prepared
image, to distinguish a missing restore-install snapshot from a naming bug.

Host run38048729480 recognizes one unencrypted System volume with UUID
C16ECAF9-9EC3-42EB-9553-B3DA1A53090F and no Data volume. macOS
listSnapshots exits1; direct read-only apfsutil probe38049010641 also finds the sole System
volume and an empty snapshot tree. This confirms the named root snapshot
is missing from the official distributable image, rather than merely hidden
from macOS. The next isolated fixture experiment creates the real name via
fs_snapshot_create, verifies it with the host snapshot listing and preserves
the original artifact. Success still requires original guest APFS authentication.

Host experiment38049627150 mounts the original System volume but the snapshot
API returns EPERM. Apple XNU vfs_context_can_snapshot requires a snapshot
entitlement even for root; the helper now requests the developer entitlement
com.apple.developer.vfs.snapshot and verifies its ad-hoc signature on macOS.
Repeat38049919032 is pending. No root-authentication assertion was skipped.
89 local tests pass, including rejecting outside fixture paths, wrong mounted
devices and detaching the isolated image after an error.
Original APFS hexadecimal alphabet at005870405 is uppercase, confirming the
expected name com.apple.os.update-BE9E51693FFC950DECA14C2D3916A94FF07C633FD3776E08E7258DBE38DC1606.

The latest NVMe readback report contains one interleaved log record, not
confirmed disk corruption: its93-byte prefix matches the source GPT header.
Readback logging now emits each bounded buffer in one call, the parser
rejects incomplete lines explicitly, and comparisons can read the exact
transfer length from the original disk.87 Python tests pass, including
payload guards, read-only APFS attachment cleanup and interleaved records.

## APFS probe rejects external NVMe; internal DT handoff under test

Full-system run38046156960 proves byte-for-byte equality of the protective
MBR, GPT header and entire16384-byte partition table in guest RAM after actual
NVMe DMA. Source CRCs are valid; partition1 has APFS GUID
7C3457EF-0000-11AA-AA11-00306543ECAC and real NXSB at its superblock offset32.
The optimized mapper also passes the hardware four-page PRP read and all
protected-range checks. The system still waits for disk0s1s1 without a panic.

Original instruction traces show IOGUIDPartitionScheme validating both CRCs,
creating and attaching a partition, then AppleAPFSContainer::probe rejecting
it before reading its superblock. At00672d320, its protocol-location helper
returns non-internal and the probe returns null at00672d328/00672d478.
IONVMeFamily checks the provider's `built-in` property at00699b9b4..00699b9cc;
without it,00699bd0c..00699bd38 explicitly sets location External.

The explicit system-root profile now describes the fixed internal virtual
disk with `built-in` on the original n112ap s3e endpoint. Original IPSW files
are preserved; no APFS branch or driver return value is patched. Ordinary
restore/control profiles retain their original DeviceTree. A test validates
SoC/endpoint guards and idempotence;81 local Python tests pass. Actual APFS
mount and system userland still require the next original-kernel run.

PMP early snapshots now capture controls/registers/ARM32 stack at the real
power notification and1/5 seconds later, then resume the guest even if capture
fails. Two control repeats reach restore launchd with13586/13551 EL0 returns;
this is restore userland evidence, not a system desktop.

## Official APFS system disk prepared; partial-page DMA corrected

Preparation run38043188715 downloaded the complete official iOS15.8.8 OS
image, verified its ZIP CRC and SHA256, converted UDIF/LZFSE on macOS and
prepared a sparse raw disk of exactly17179869184 bytes. GPT backup headers
were relocated to the final sector; the APFS partition extents were preserved.
The `ios-system-disk` artifact is a real system volume, not a blank scratch disk.

First full-system probe38043454159 initialized NVMe but stopped at
`Still waiting for root device`. Its actual buffer descriptor
`0x00001ff04f2e0001` exposed the wrong physical-address mask: the mapper treated
the subpage end field as physical address bits. Original T8010 code masks
physical addresses to36 bits. The mapper now applies that mask and enforces
the inclusive byte bounds in bits48..59 and36..47 when bit1 is clear.

The real ARM64 DART/MSI guest passes a512-byte permitted read, rejects a read
beyond that subpage, preserves denied/unmapped destination pages, verifies a
persisted disk sector and handles actual EL1 IRQs. A follow-up guest also
exercises a write source whose permitted subpage starts at byte512.
79 local Python tests pass. Full-system repeat38044369800 has no DMA rejection
and reads LBAs0,1 and the32-sector GPT table at LBA2, but still waits for
disk0s1s1 with zero EL0 returns. No kernel panic occurs in this system repeat.
The separate restore repeat38044369497 reproduces the intermittent PMP NMI.

The next probe adds read-only source GPT/type/extent/APFS-prefix inspection
and bounded readback of the first512 bytes delivered by actual NVMe DMA.
It compares guest bytes against the prepared disk, distinguishing transfer
corruption from partition discovery without changing either source or guest.

Full-system CI now requires original system launchd and actual EL0 returns,
excludes restore userland and rejects a kernel panic. A timed root wait cannot
produce a successful boot gate. SpringBoard and native IPA integration remain
unconfirmed.

## Original iOS publishes disk0 and reads sectors through DART and MSI

Run38042475924 original MSI profile logs `Successfully initialized NVMe drive`,
publishes IONVMeBlockStorageDevice and disk0, creates real CQ1/SQ1 and reads
namespace1 LBAs0 and1. Identify, Set Features, queue creation, log page and
namespace discovery complete without command timeout. Actual endpoint MSI
writes reach AIC288. Restore launchd/early boot also pass with13531 EL0 returns.
The overall run is still red because the independent fresh PMP repeat fails.

A strict new storage gate requires original driver initialization, published
disk0/block device, I/O queues, MSI and sector reads with no command timeout.
It passes the downloaded real trace. 69 local Python tests pass using a
workspace temporary-directory workaround for the Windows tempfile ACL issue.

SpringBoard remains unconfirmed. The empty scratch disk has no system volume.
Official IPSW OS member098-68748-067.dmg is4813157696 bytes, ZIP_STORED, CRC
ba122ac6. Its checked UDIF trailer/resources describe14139459 sectors,
GPT and Apple_APFS at sector34/count14139392. Chunk type0x80000007 is LZFSE;
raw and zero chunks are also present. Small range reads inspected metadata;
the full OS image has not yet been downloaded or prepared as a boot volume.

## Real NVMe MSI-X delivery passes the ARM64 EL1 guest

Run38042475924 passes the real DART+MSI guest. Every submitted admin/I/O
command must both complete and enter an actual EL1 IRQ handler. The handler
claims AIC event0x10120 (IRQ288); NVMe emits a real message to0xbffff000/data0.
The guest still verifies persisted sector I/O and unchanged protected pages.
This is an interrupt-delivery milestone, not evidence of a desktop boot.

The independent original-kernel profile with MSI is now executing. The prior
instrumented original driver sends exactly address0xbffff000/data0/vector0,
matching original DeviceTree msi-address and msi-vector-offset288. The new
port0 research aperture bypasses normal DART page-table translation for MSI,
accepts only four-byte writes at offset0 with data0..7 and latches an AIC edge.
Claim consumes the edge while retaining existing auto-mask and level behavior.
Direct DMA, DART-only controls, other ports and unimplemented DART fault IRQs
are not converted into this MSI path. Native IPA integration remains absent.

The MSI assembly's nonencodable immediate and assumed BAR4 location were caught
and corrected. A new early workflow step compiles all three guest variants
before firmware fetch and backend compilation.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38042475924

## Verified DART I/O and original Identify completion; MSI routing still missing

Run38041269540 passes both actual ARM64 NVMe guests. The DART guest performs
nonidentity queue/buffer DMA, writes and reads a sector, verifies its persisted
bytes independently on the host, and leaves both denied-write and invalid-leaf
destination pages unchanged. Actual mapper rejection logs are required. A
posted DMA write failure need not produce a failing NVMe CQ status; the test
checks memory protection and the mapper instead. Fault IRQs are not implemented.
The sparse disk has exactly17179869184 logical bytes and16384 allocated bytes.

The original iOS driver now submits Identify Controller opcode6/CNS1, obtains
a successful completion, and QEMU emits MSI-X vector0. The destination
0xbffff000 has no valid ordinary DART mapping, so interrupt delivery is absent
and the original driver times out. The research restore profile nevertheless
runs launchd and restored_extern. This is not SpringBoard or full iOS boot.
The ordinary PMP integration gate still fails; overall CI is not green.

Next instrumentation records the genuine NVMe MSI-X address/data and includes
read-only original port/channel control snapshots. It does not synthesize
interrupts, completion or readiness. These measurements must precede routing.

## Original Identify queue located through observed port0 DART mapping

Run38040341863 diagnostic captures ASQ IOVA0x86d30000. The observed31-bit PCIe
window with4K tables reads TTBR0=0x80055de8, L1@0x55de81b0=0x55dee003,
L2@0x55dee980=0x54c1c003, physical ASQ0x54c1c000. That queue contains actual
opcode6, CNS1 and PRP1=0x86d48000: the original Identify Controller command.
The direct DMA path had read opcode0 at the untransformed IOVA instead.

A separately opted-in research port0 mapper now walks original little-endian
4K tables, bounds tables/output to RAM and enforces leaf read/write permission.
It preserves direct controls when disabled and reports unmapped DMA as errors.
The new real NVMe guest uses nonidentity IOVAs for all queues/buffers and checks
persistent sector I/O plus denied-write and invalid-leaf rejections without changing
destination pages. Original-kernel translation runs only after this guest passes.
MSI, other streams, DAPF and hardware fault IRQ behavior remain unimplemented.

The same run's full boot catches an intermittent genuine PMP NMI (no response
to AP power notification in20s) before userland. The new strict restore regression
gate correctly fails; earlier155/156 restored_extern boots are confirmed but
stable launch and full desktop boot are not established. 66 local tests pass;
new mapper compile/ARM64 execution validation follow.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38040341863

## Original DART root pages captured before command timeout

Run 38039924882 captures the original tables before any NVMe FatalHandling:
ASQ IOVA0x86b9c000, TTBR0..3=0x80055e80..83. Four nonzero64-bit root entries
appear at physical0x55e801a0..1b8:0x55e64003,0x55e65003,0x55e66003,0x55e67003.
Both unmodified-address4K/16K table walks select invalid zero entries. A separate
31-bit PCIe-address candidate matches the observed4K root occupancy and will
read the next-level descriptors and actual submission queue. This candidate is
diagnostic only: no assumed inbound remapping or DMA translation is installed.

Run38039538343 again confirms real launchd hello, restore environment and14237
EL0 returns. Its16 GiB disk uses16384 physical bytes after persisted sector I/O.
A strict independent NVMe restore-userland regression check is now added;
the preexisting PMP/control boot gates remain intact. Full desktop boot is absent.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38039924882

---

## Original iOS restore launchd and restored_extern now execute with real NVMe attached

Run 38039000833 boots the independent NVMe+CFI+PMP research experiment far
past the PCIe assertion: original IONVMeController binds to the real QEMU NVMe.
The actual serial log contains launchd pid1 hello, early boot completion and
restored_extern pid3 restore checkpoints. Trace records 14137 EL0 returns,
first PC0x100ddd170. This confirms original restore userland execution; it does
not establish SpringBoard, full system boot or a native working IPA.

NVMe remains broken under the original guest's mapper: the Apple driver queues
Identify Controller, but QEMU DMA reads opcode0 (Delete SQ), returns an error
and raises MSI-X; the guest eventually reports command timeout. Port0 DART
TTBRs are programmed at +0x40..4c and the ASQ IOVA is0x857b4000. The backend
still does direct DMA without DART translation or Apple MSI routing.

The next separate bounded diagnostic stops at the first real NVMe command and
reads the original DART tables before teardown. It reports 4K/16K table-layout
candidates and actual physical queue words without applying guessed translation.
The complete boot experiment remains separate. 66 Python unit tests pass;
real queue DMA/read/write was verified independently on the fixed16 GiB disk.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38039000833

## Real NVMe read/write verified; original driver link-state accessor corrected

Run 38038770887 successfully enumerates the real root-port/NVMe endpoint,
identifies namespace1 as exactly 17179869184 bytes (16 GiB), creates I/O queues,
DMA-writes LBA8 and reads it back. Independent host file inspection confirms
all 512 persisted bytes. This is real stock QEMU block I/O, not a register ACK.
Polling was tested; Apple DART, MSI and native IPA integration are still absent.

Original PCIe trace shows _waitForLinkUp uses PC0xfffffff00694e36c and reads
port0+0x208 bit0, while the separate link-state accessor reads bit6. Both bits
now derive from actual QEMU root-port DLLLA and the original port-enable
controls. Empty-port guest tests reject forged link bits. The independent iOS
NVMe experiment remains gated on genuine admin/I/O DMA guest success.

Restore launchd hello and SpringBoard are still unverified. Original mandatory
PMP and restore launchd boot gates remain unchanged.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38038770887

---

## Real NVMe backend experiment; original PCIe link timeout isolated

Run 38037759808 passes the exact original DeviceTree PCIe aperture guest
check, but both kernel probes now reach a real port0 link-training timeout.
There was no downstream storage endpoint; the model correctly kept link down.

A separate opt-in backend now connects stock QEMU PCIe root-port and NVMe
at the original ECAM and PCI MMIO windows. Its scratch disk is always 16 GiB;
existing files are never silently resized. Direct DMA and polling are under
test; Apple DART/MSI and native IPA integration remain unimplemented.

Run 38038593460 compiles this backend and its ARM64 guest enumerates PCI,
enables NVMe and completes Identify Controller DMA. The guest then rejects
NN because it mistakenly expected an active namespace count of one. Pinned
QEMU sets NN to its namespace limit. That assertion is corrected; Identify
Namespace and persistent read/write checks must still pass before the kernel
experiment runs. Port0 link status now derives from the actual root-port DLLLA
and the original port-enable controls; the no-disk guest checks cannot forge it.

There is still no restore launchd hello or SpringBoard boot. The strict original
PMP and restore-userland gates are unchanged. The new NVMe kernel probe is
separate and runs only after successful real guest disk I/O verification.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38038593460

## Original DeviceTree validation catches exact PHY span mismatch

Run 38037480360 rejects the new DeviceTree aperture check before boot: the
original final PHY range is base0x60a000000, size0x40000, not0x4000. This single
original span includes all four lane strides0x10000. The model now uses that
exact span and removes the speculative separate lane banks. The guest derives
all bank addresses and bounds from original DeviceTree and separately probes
lane controls. No prepared DeviceTree range is enlarged. Compile and kernel
validation follow. iOS desktop boot remains unverified.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38037480360

---

## Exact PHY base fixed; original driver requires per-lane stride apertures

Run 38037441527 reads and programs PHY lane0 at exact 0x60a000000, then
aborts at FAR translated by QMP to 0x60a010088, original PC0xfffffff00694d73c.
Original driver addresses lane-specific controls at stride0x10000; the reg[11]
base span alone excludes lane1. Separate bounded0x4000 lane1..3 controls now
follow this observed accessor layout. The guest exercises +0x88 across these
independent banks in addition to the original DeviceTree-declared ranges.
No analog PHY, link-up or DMA completion is inferred. Kernel validation pending.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38037441527

---

## Genuine PCIe PHY register FAR reveals a preexisting aperture typo

Run 38037265062 passes the lane-state guest and original driver exits its
PHY wait. Both kernel probes then data-abort at PC 0xfffffff00694d73c reading
PHY +0x180. QMP translates the actual FAR to 0x60a000180. Original DeviceTree
reg[11] declares base 0x60a000000 length0x4000, whereas the earlier bank table
mistyped it as 0x6000a0000. The model and guest aperture table now use the exact
original physical range. No kernel panic instruction is patched. Compile and
kernel validation follow; full iOS startup remains unconfirmed.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38037265062

---

## PCIe speed panic cleared; research PHY lane request state added

Run 38036919703 passes PCIe-v2 speed-vector checks and no longer hits either
capability or speed panic. Its stopped stack reaches 0xfffffff00694eff8,
waiting for PHY lane status at 0x60000800c after enabling port0 +0x124=0x31.
Original lane-cfg=0 handling requests two lanes for port0; DeviceTree exposes
bridge0 storage and bridge3 WLAN. The research model now derives ready bits
from port enable requests (port0 mask3, other ports one lane) and removes them
on disable. This is explicit virtual PHY state, not analog calibration or
PCI link-up. An ARM64 guest verifies enable/disable and status independence.
Original kernel validation is pending. This run's PMP startup evidence is
incomplete and md0 mount fails, so it is not successful userland progression.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38036919703

---

## Original PCIe v2 speed-vector dependency identified

Run 38036762119 still panics at limitedSpeed > 0 despite valid Gen1
LinkCapabilities. Original code 0xfffffff006822314..3b4 instead reads PCIe v2
Supported Link Speeds Vector (capability +0x2c), searches bits1..7 and rejects
an empty vector. The virtual root port now advertises only Gen1 in this
read-only vector (0x2), covered by the ARM64 config guest. Kernel validation
runs in 38036919703. LinkStatus stays zero and downstream buses stay absent.
No usable iOS boot has been verified.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38036762119

---

## PCIe capability list accepted; virtual maximum speed added

Run 38036534007 passes root-port configuration guest checks. Both original
kernel probes advance beyond the missing _expressCapOffset panic and stop
at AppleEmbeddedPCIEPort::setMaximumLinkSpeed, limitedSpeed > 0. The virtual
root-port capability omitted its maximum link speed. Gen1 x1 is now declared
read-only in LinkCapabilities and tested while actual LinkStatus stays zero.
This describes research virtual capabilities only; no endpoint or PCI DMA
has been implemented. The next kernel probe must validate this change.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38036534007

---

## PCIe channel reset removed; virtual root-port capability validation pending

Run 38036292150 passes the channel reset guest: reg[1] +4 bit16 self-clears,
without a DMA completion claim. Both normal and independent kernel probes
advance and panic at AppleT801xPCIePort::enablePortHardware because
_expressCapOffset is zero. The prior empty PCI config aperture supplied no
root-port capabilities. No EL0 or userland is reached in these probes.

fcbbc27 adds explicit virtual QEMU-identity PCIe root-port config on bus0
and leaves downstream buses absent. Type1 headers, capability-list status,
PCIe v2 root-port capability and zero link status are checked by an ARM64
guest. This is research topology, not a claim of exact Apple port config.
Compile, guest checks and original-kernel validation run in 38036534007.
No launchd, SpringBoard or usable iOS IPA has been verified.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38036292150

## Original user code progresses; PCIe common-control second phase added

Run 38035660772 passes the first PCIe request check, confirms PMP startup and
records 901 EL0 returns in its normal 120-second restore probe. The stopped
stack advances from PCIe 0xfffffff00694d69c to 0xfffffff00694eef4: the original
driver first waits for status +0x28 bit4 and then for bit0. No launchd hello or
SpringBoard is observed. Both response bits now derive from the same observed
+0x124 bit0 request, with reset tested; kernel validation is pending in
run 38035964095. This remains an explicit research control acknowledgement,
not an authenticated hardware handoff or a functioning PCIe/NVMe endpoint.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38035660772

---

## SPI fix validated; next stop is original PCIe control acknowledgement

Run 38035420066 passes the SPI W1C guest check and its normal 120-second boot
records 34 EL0 returns. The stopped stack now waits in original AppleT8010PCIe
at 0xfffffff00694d69c instead of the previous Samsung SPI acknowledgement loop.
The earlier independent CFI/AES experiment recorded 595 EL0 returns and actual
AES work without the prior AES panic. Neither confirms launchd or SpringBoard.

Original PCIe code writes bit0 to common-control +0x124 and loops until bit4
appears at +0x28, with a 10-us delay and no finite retry bound. A research
request acknowledgement now derives that status bit from the request and
clears it when the request clears. It does not advertise PCI link-up, PHY
calibration, endpoints or NVMe. An ARM64 guest checks both request transitions;
real kernel validation is pending in run 38035660772.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38035420066

## First genuine EL0 execution observed; Samsung SPI polling livelock fixed

Run 38035038416 passes QEMU build and all mandatory hardware guests, including
AES CBC STORE_IV DMA. Its normal PMP probe confirms original firmware startup,
mounts restore md0, and records nine genuine EL1-to-EL0 exception returns,
first PC 0x105375170. launchd hello, restore environment and SpringBoard are
absent, so booted_ios and userland_execution_confirmed correctly remain false.
This probe does not enable the AES SecureRoot fallback or CFI NVRAM experiment.

Its stopped PC 0xfffffff005d77b7c and stack are in the original Samsung SPI
controller polling path. Trace repeatedly reads +8 status 0x0040000f, writes
that same value to acknowledge it, and reads the unchanged value again.
The old register backing store manufactured permanently pending events by
latching the acknowledge. SPI +8 now clears written bits (W1C). An ARM64 guest
checks the original mask, configuration independence and refusal to create
pending events by acknowledgement. SPI slave transfers are still absent.
The next real boot probe must establish whether clearing this livelock lets
userland advance; no completed iOS boot is claimed.

Previous independent AES experiment 38034538374 executed actual AES-256 CBC
with the original kernel's software key, then panicked on missing STORE_IV.
The two-word STORE_IV handler writes the actual chaining IV to bounded RAM,
verified against the final ciphertext of the CBC decryption known answer.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38035038416

---

## AES software-key known answers, DMA guards and IRQ verified; iOS boot pending

Run 38032593352 confirms original PMP startup in both normal fresh-machine
probes and mounts genuine restore md0. Its independent 180-second CFI
experiment panics with `cannot find IOAESAccelerator`. Original disassembly
identifies an unmet SecureRoot callback: the earlier restore-only
IOSecureBSDRoot research return omits that callback.

A separately opted-in, whole-kernel-hash and instruction-signature guarded
experiment returns kIOReturnUnsupported from AES SecureRoot registration.
It does not alter ordinary probes or native IPA. Run 38033374188 then reaches
`AppleS8000AESAccelerator::_enableAES: DPA has not been seeded!`, proving the
next initialization dependency. This is not a successful iOS boot.

The external model now implements software-key AES-v2 ECB/CBC commands and
bounded physical RAM DMA through QEMU crypto. Unknown UID/GID and wrapped
keys remain errors. No encrypted payload is accepted as plaintext. DPA-ready
bits represent explicit research initialization, not physical hardware seeding.
DART/SART translation and cycle-accurate FIFO timing remain unimplemented.
AES-128 NIST ECB encryption and CBC encryption/decryption are mandatory ARM64
guest checks before the original-kernel experiment.

Run 38034381202 exposed a pinned-QEMU cipher enum mismatch, corrected in
67fb4a3. Run 38034538374 successfully builds QEMU and passes ARM64 NIST ECB
encryption/CBC encryption/decryption, real AIC source 237 assertion/deassertion,
and out-of-RAM/partial-block/unknown-key refusal without changing output.
63 local Python tests pass, including bounded physical QMP snapshot coverage.
Original-kernel boot experiments are running. No EL0, launchd, SpringBoard or
usable IPA is verified.
Original-firmware PMP startup evidence remains intermittently incomplete;
its strict gate stays enabled and independent CFI evidence stays separate.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38033374188

## Restore md0 mounted; VXD NULL dereference removed, userland still absent

Run 38031635420 passed UART discovery and mounted the genuine restore HFS
RAMDisk md0, then panicked in AppleD5500 at PC 0xfffffff006451c70 with FAR 0x14.
Original disassembly proves the decoder's firmware descriptor is NULL: its
SRAM-size query +0x500 returns zero, so the embedded-image selector rejects it.
The caller nevertheless dereferences that absent image after logging failure.

The original SRAM-size formula at 0xfffffff006461738 decodes bank geometry;
firmware descriptor VA 0xfffffff007a4f318 has image size 0xa1a0. The model now
explicitly advertises one 64-KiB research SRAM bank (config 0x0e000100). Exact
ASIC geometry is unknown; this is not a claim of a working VXD decoder. An
ARM64 guest checks the exact driver's capacity calculation and read-only config.

Run 38032087540 passes all register checks, mounts md0, and executes the entire
120-second interval without the previous panic. There are zero observed EL0
returns and no launchd hello. ApplePMP reports started, but the original firmware
console startup line is absent, so the mandatory PMP evidence gate correctly
fails. The peer still executes its original scheduler; genuine message exchange
continues. This run is not a confirmed PMP or iOS boot.

A separate firmware-transmit staging word now preserves the published message
while staging the next low word, with an ARM64 consumer-between-words test.
An independent 180-second probe adds the existing synthetic CFI NVRAM provider
to isolate post-mount startup; the ordinary strict probe remains separate. Both
follow-ups are pending. 61 Python tests pass locally. No usable iOS IPA exists.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38032087540

## Repeated genuine PMP startup and progress through ISP/display discovery

Runs 38030604802, 38030933219 and 38031286874 each pass both mandatory
fresh-machine PMP startup probes. The separate bounded message-port log budget
records genuine firmware reads even after AP status polling; all strict protocol
and original-firmware startup evidence is now present in both runs of each pair.

Run 38030604802 passes VXD discovery and stops at ISP revision read
0x205ba0000. Run 38030933219 passes that ISP access and stops at disp0 control
read 0x206400004. Run 38031286874 passes the display read and stops at uart5
UCON read 0x20a0d4004. Every physical address is resolved from the exact stopped
AP virtual fault address by QMP and matched against the original n112ap DT.

Independent discovery/control apertures and ARM64 guest checks were added for
VXD, ISP and all nine disp0 banks. This does not implement image processing,
video decode, display scanout or camera frames. Five separate polling UARTs are
now mapped from the original DT, with console output only for UART0 and no
fabricated RX data or Bluetooth peer; their next kernel validation is pending.

61 Python tests continue to pass. Actual restore launchd/EL0, normal iOS root
storage and graphical SpringBoard are not confirmed. All progress here is in
the external QEMU research backend, not a verified working iOS emulator IPA.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38031286874

## PMP startup, bounded message FIFO and later display/video faults

Runs 38030017923 and 38030307496 both print genuine `ApplePMP: started`
and original firmware `[PMP:main.cpp:579] PMP started`. The second fresh-machine
probe in 38030017923 also reaches both startup messages. Its strict evidence
gate rejects the run because status polling exhausted the shared trace budget
before the firmware data-port read was recorded. A separate bounded data-port
budget has been added; the gate still requires actual consumed-message evidence.

The AP-to-PMP mailbox now uses a research FIFO of capacity 16, rather than a
single slot which dropped original endpoint-start bursts. Its exact ASIC depth
is not established. ARM64 guest checks cover full/empty flags, ordered draining,
rejected overflow, low/high-word publication, and a consumer freeing space
between low-word staging and high-word publication.

Original XNU passed the JPEG reset banks, 64-bit PMGR bridge accesses and scaler0
reset/discovery banks. Run 38030307496 stops at PC 0xfffffff006451a5c with physical
fault address 0x208130004, resolved by stopped-AP QMP translation to the original
DT `/device-tree/arm-io/vxd` secondary bank. VXD control windows and a guest
read/modify/write check have been added; their follow-up is pending. Codec DMA,
video decoding and scaler pixel processing are not implemented.

61 Python tests pass locally. This is still the external QEMU research backend:
no restore launchd/EL0, normal iOS root mount, SpringBoard or usable emulator IPA
is confirmed. Native fixed 16-GiB sparse storage is not yet guest NVMe storage.

## Verified original PMP protocol exchanges in both directions

Run 38028974526 confirms AP reads the authentic firmware hello, responds with
version 12, and PMP consumes that response through its real ARM32 receive
handler. Further real messages advertise endpoints and negotiate buffers.
CPU#1 has no data abort. Main XNU no longer stops at the prior PMP status-4/5
20-second timeout in this run: the new fatal point is AppleJPEGDriver's reset
write at original PC 0xfffffff0060edc88 (STR W9,[X8,#8]).

The driver module was resolved from the original __PRELINK_INFO metadata and
its __TEXT_EXEC Mach-O segment, not inferred from an arbitrary register value.
The original n112ap DT maps JPEG0/JPEG1 at 0x207b00000/0x207b08000, each 0x4000.
Discovery/reset controls and a guest reset-sequence test have been added;
codec DMA and encode/decode results remain unsupported. Follow-up is pending.

All previous hardware tests and 59 Python tests pass. Both processors genuinely
execute original firmware/kernel instructions; no protocol responses are
fabricated. Restore EL0, launchd and graphical SpringBoard are still absent.
This remains an external research backend, not a usable iOS emulator IPA.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38028974526

## Verified genuine RTKit hello delivered to XNU

Run 38028780454 confirms the corrected AP receive IRQ 170. The original PMP
sends 0x00100000000c000c; XNU reads it through +0x4038/+0x403c and sends the
version-12 HELLO_REPLY 0x00200000000c000c through +0x4010/+0x4014. These are
executed original firmware/kernel instructions, not hardcoded model replies.
RTBuddy's pending state advances from 4 to 5. Full handshake still stalls:
CPU#1 remains in scheduler WFI at 0x01007718 and has not consumed the AP reply.
The new private IOP receive-event/IRQ implementation is being tested next.

Original firmware IOP interrupt dispatcher at 0x0100bf94 reads bank +0x81c;
its validator at 0x0100c1fc accepts event type 4/source 0 for mailbox receive.
This controller is separate from the AP AIC. The original +0xb88 enable bit
and real inbox occupancy gate the new receive event and ARM32 IRQ.

QMP snapshots now correctly show CPU#1 ARM32 registers via per-request
cpu-index. All modeled-device checks and 59 Python tests pass. No launchd,
SpringBoard or usable iOS IPA is confirmed.

## Verified shared-memory PMP execution and bidirectional mailbox queues

Run 38028359295 verifies the original ARM32 firmware executing alongside ARM64
XNU in the same QEMU process. XNU copies firmware into its original SRAM window
and writes release +0x38; the generic Cortex-A7 research core then enters the
unaltered reset body through a private low SRAM alias. A second TCG context is
reserved without creating a second AP. PMP sends its original version-12 hello
at +0xbb0/+0xbb4. This is actual firmware execution, not an emulated RTKit reply.

Run 38028112335 also passes guest tests for both data directions, publication
only after the high word, occupied-slot protection, read consumption/refill,
and AIC receive assertion/deassertion. Receive registers +0xb98/+0xb9c and send
registers +0xbb0/+0xbb4 come from executed original firmware instructions.

Full handshake is not yet confirmed: run 38028359295 leaves the hello queued
and XNU still panics with RTBuddy(PMP) status 4 after 20 seconds. The trace shows
source 167 masked and original XNU enabling source 170 (DTS interrupt index 2).
The receive IRQ has now been corrected to 170; its follow-up is pending.
QMP snapshots were also corrected to select the peer through cpu-index on the
individual request, since a separate HMP cpu command did not persist selection.

59 Python tests pass locally. Launchd/EL0, SpringBoard, normal root storage,
and a usable iOS IPA remain unconfirmed. Fixed native 16-GiB backing is unchanged.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/38028359295

## Verified PMP milestone: original firmware reaches scheduler WFI

Run 37988746111 executes 1516 distinct authentic ARM32 blocks. The corrected
legacy status +0xb88 ends the zero-message drain. There is no data abort;
the stopped PC 0x01007718 follows THUMB DSB/WFI at 0x01007712/0x01007716
and returns via BX LR. Calling code at 0x01009b30 belongs to the scheduler.
Register patterns deadc0de/b0bed0ff alone are not evidence of a panic.
The original firmware is now waiting for a real interrupt/message. Reports
separately track scheduler-WFI and data-abort evidence, keeping full PMP
boot and iOS boot unconfirmed. Firmware-hash guarded instruction bytes
avoid treating arbitrary register patterns as completion.

All individual research hardware checks pass in this run: SPI controls,
I2C empty-bus NACK/W1C, GPIO pull-ups, genuine AIC IRQ/ERET, DART controls,
PCIe discovery, AOP timebase and firmware RAM boundaries. Main ARM64 XNU
still times out after 20 seconds waiting for PMP (_iopStatus=4), since the
ARM32 experiment is a separate process with no connected AP peer. Next
substantial implementation is shared or bridged AP/IOP message queues,
interrupts and memory ownership between the real firmware and ARM64 XNU.
Normal root storage, graphical SpringBoard and a usable iOS IPA are still
unconfirmed. Fixed native 16-GiB backing disk remains unchanged.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/37988746111

---

## Correct arithmetic of the captured legacy mailbox object

Run 37988260194 still drains zero messages. Re-read the captured structure:
0x01014540 = object+0x90 contains [4,8,0x10,0x18]. Therefore field +0x94
is 8, and +0x9c is 0x18, not 4/0x10. Combined with base 0xc0500b80, the
status is +0xb88 and 64-bit receive data is +0xb98. The stopped R02 confirms
0xc0500b98 at message load. Prior +0xb84 assignment was an analysis error;
move the derived empty bit to +0xb88, preserving all other controls. Real
firmware and regression verification pending. No ready response fabricated.

---

## Runtime firmware object resolves exact legacy receive status/data offsets

Run 37987733454 captures the actual PMP mailbox object at 0x010144b0.
Field +8 is 0xc0500b80; fields +0x94/+0x9c are offsets 4/0x10. The receive
helper adds those fields, so it reads status at 0xc0500b84 and message at
0xc0500b90. The prior +0xb80 alias applied to the base control address and
could not fix the drain loop. Move derived empty bit17 to exact +0xb84 and
remove its treatment at +0xb80. Regression checks target the observed status
address. No message or firmware-ready state is invented; next trace must
confirm leaving the drain loop. Main XNU still awaits a real PMP peer.

---

## Legacy queue empty check passes; firmware loop still requires exact object mapping

Run 37987144912 passes the +0xb80 empty-view regression, but firmware still
loops in its receive-drain helper. The stopped R02=0xc0500b80 is the message
address after the helper's pointer arithmetic, so it does not establish
that the control read is at +0xb80. Preserve evidence and capture only the
44-word firmware mailbox object at 0x010144b0; its +0x94/+0x9c pointers will
identify actual control/data apertures. Do not claim the previous alias
fixed real firmware execution. Main XNU still times out waiting for PMP.
Next stopped-object diagnostic pending; no firmware/iOS boot confirmed.

---

## PMP no longer data-aborts; legacy receive status caused endless zero-message draining

Run 37986404202 executes 1330 real PMP blocks with no post-relocation data
abort. It loops at 0x0100c432 calling 0x0100c6dc: reads legacy receive control
at virtual 0xc0500b80, tests bit17 for empty, and reads a 64-bit message if
clear. The passive model left bit17 clear, falsely reporting an endless
queue of zero words. Implement empty-bit17 on legacy +0xb80 just as the
modern +0x4020 view. Retain low control bits, but no AP message is fabricated.
ARM64 tests verify reset-empty and that writing zero or control 0x1100 cannot
clear derived emptiness. Next real firmware trace remains pending. A genuine
AP/IOP peer and shared execution are still required for PMP/iOS boot.

---

## PMP advances through AIC setup; next write is an existing PMGR aperture

Run 37985453138 executes 1111 authentic ARM32 firmware blocks (previously
755) after its AIC CPU view becomes accessible. Next fault is a store at
DFAR 0xc00d4004, translated physical 0x20e0d4004. Original DeviceTree PMGR
reg[1] covers 0x20e000000..0x20e100000; this is not an unverified UART.
The main research board already maps it in PMGR raw controls. Enable that
same discovery/control model in the explicit standalone PMP probe. No
additional success flags or firmware replies are supplied. Next firmware
trace will show whether further command semantics or register windows are
required. Main XNU/firmware integration is still absent; no iOS boot claim.

---

## PMP private CPU view maps to the real AIC region

Run 37984678914 confirms firmware DFAR 0xc0101028 translates to physical
0x20e101028. This is an AIC CPU register view, not a new timer or invented
mailbox. Extend the existing AIC CPU0 view with the observed +0x1000 alias,
preserving original +0x2000/+0x5000 views. ARM64 tests verify WHOAMI and
cross-view IPI set/ack behavior. The explicit standalone PMP probe realizes
AIC and routes its output alongside the normal GIC through the IRQ OR.
No software event is synthesized: authentic ARM32 firmware drives its own
AIC registers. Subsequent IRQ/controller initialization validation pending.
Main ARM64 still lacks a connected PMP firmware peer and does not boot iOS.

---

## PMP code advances with mapped control aperture; supply authentic boot descriptor shape

Run 37983815067 executes 755 distinct original firmware TBs (previously
483), passing the first high-address mailbox faults. The next data abort
has DFAR 0xc0101028; the snapshot's active page tables will now translate
all observed DFARs automatically. The probe's mailbox boot descriptor was
zero, while actual XNU writes load low/high at +8/+0x10, arguments at
+0x18/+0x20, reserved SRAM length 0x20000 at +0x28, and boot-enable at +0x38.
Mirror these inputs in the standalone probe using its real load 0x41000000;
keep all firmware response/status queues empty. This is boot input metadata,
not a synthesized PMP-ready reply. ARMv7 counter frequency is 24 MHz to match
the main research platform. Exact board and ARM64 integration remain absent.
Next genuine firmware execution validation pending.

---

## PMP firmware uses LPAE to address the same high physical mailbox

Run 37983124660 executes the same 483 authentic firmware TBs. Stopped QMP
gva2gpa resolves 0xc0500040 -> 0x20e300040 and 0xc0500008 -> 0x20e300008.
The ARMv7-A firmware uses LPAE physical addresses above 32 bits; dropping the
high bits would be wrong. An explicit guarded firmware backend now opts the
standalone Cortex-A7 probe into the existing high-address PMP mailbox and
system control apertures. This is still separate from ARM64 XNU: passive
controls do not supply an AP peer, fake replies or a completed PMP boot.
The next actual firmware execution trace must reveal subsequent hardware
access or mailbox operations. Original kernel still waits for PMP firmware.

---

## Actual ARM32 PMP code executes and relocates; next access needs private I/O map

Run 37982337383 confirms reset-body execution and 483 distinct actual TBs
from the authentic embedded firmware. It enables CP15/VFP and relocates
execution into virtual 0x01000000. It then data-aborts with DFSR 0x210,
DFAR 0xc0500040 (and subsequently 0xc0500008), and eventually enters the
abort-stack validation loop at 0x01000834. This is not firmware-ready or
PMP/iOS boot. Register r2=0x0e300008 suggests a private PMP control mapping,
but it is not the fault address; inspect the active page tables before
choosing a physical aperture. QMP snapshots now ask gva2gpa for the two
observed fault VAs and retain the actual last executed PCs/DFAR evidence.
Main XNU still waits for a genuine PMP response after 20 seconds.

---

## Standalone PMP probe reserves virt bootloader DTB memory

Run 37981854516 stops before ARM32 execution: generic virt loads its DTB at
0x40000000..0x40100000, overlapping the standalone firmware load address.
Move the synthetic probe to 0x41000000 (main XNU platform is unchanged).
The firmware is position-aware but its real PMP memory map is still absent.
Capture a stopped ARM32 QMP register snapshot before terminating, alongside
actual executed-TB trace. This distinguishes code execution from a loader
attempt and identifies the next unsupported instruction or memory access.
No standalone PMP boot is yet confirmed; validation pending.

---

## Initial device apertures pass; real kernel now waits for PMP firmware

Run 37980997607 passes all device checks including the monotonic AOP counter.
Original kernel gets past prior missing-register aborts, then RTBuddy(PMP)
asserts after 20 seconds without a firmware response (_iopStatus 4).
The passive mailbox/SRAM controls never realized a coprocessor; a fake
ready message would hide rather than implement the missing firmware.

The next bounded experiment extracts the actual 123296-byte embedded PMP
image at kernel VA 0xfffffff007b01000 (hash guarded) and executes it on a
generic Cortex-A7 ARMv7-A baseline in a separate QEMU virt process. Original
reset branches to offset 0x68 and uses CP15/VFP/translation registers.
Execution trace must show the reset body actually entering a TB, not just
being disassembled. This is not an exact PMP CPU/board or completed firmware
boot: peripherals, private memory map, mailbox peer and integration into
ARM64 XNU remain necessary. Reports explicitly keep PMP/iOS boot false.
No raw Apple firmware is uploaded in evidence. Prototype validation pending.

---

## Original AOP time synchronization reaches its missing free-running counter

Run 37980153266 passes PCIe controls and ECAM widths. Next kernel fault is
PC 0xfffffff005e1e3e8 reading physical 0x21000040c, AOP reg[3] high counter.
Original code reads high/low/high and retries on high rollover. Constructor
constants at 0xfffffff0055da960 give offsets 0/4; default conversion pair at
0xfffffff0055da970 is 15625/512 microseconds per tick (32768 Hz). Optional
aop-fr-timebase uses 1/24 microseconds (24 MHz), but original DT lacks it.

Provide the read-only 32768-Hz counter from QEMU virtual nanoseconds, with
split 32-bit access and monotonic progress. Add distinct AOP system control
reg[2] at 0x210000500/0x100, mailbox reg[0] at 0x210800000/0x1c000, and
640-KiB firmware SRAM reg[1] at 0x210e00000. Counter is not a success flag;
firmware execution and mailbox replies remain absent. ARM64 tests cover
stable reads, time progress, ignored writes, and system/SRAM bounds. Pending.

---

## DART discovery passes; next access is PCIe common control

Run 37979534877 passes DART programming tests and advances to original
PCIe register write at PC 0xfffffff00681d708, physical 0x600000004,
/devicetree/arm-io/apcie reg[9] (32-KiB common control). Provide the 11 exact
control/PHY apertures independently from existing DART regions, plus the
16-MiB configuration window at 0x610000000. No endpoint is attached:
configuration reads return all ones for byte/halfword/word accesses, writes
have no effect. No PHY-ready/link-up status or NVMe device is synthesized.
ARM64 tests check all control banks, widths and the ECAM end boundary.
Next kernel validation pending; restore root remains a real RAMDisk.

---

## I2C pull-up regression passes; original ISP DART is the next device

Run 37978974681 passes six-pin GPIO electrical tests. The original driver
sets each SCL/SDA pin to peripheral/input config 0x221 and now samples high,
advancing beyond the prior bad-bus assertion. The next data abort writes
0x0020fffc to physical 0x205b28024, original PC 0xfffffff0060d7ba4.
DeviceTree identifies dart-isp reg[0] within the encompassing ISP aperture.
Original routine writes a shifted table address at +0x24, stream control
at +0xc (with readback check), and configuration at +0x30/+0x20.

Add the 12 exact independent DART register windows in original DeviceTree,
including the 8-KiB scaler bank and the two PCIe DARTs. ARM64 checks cover
table/stream programming and each window's boundary. DMA address translation,
permission enforcement, faults and cache invalidation semantics remain absent;
no peripheral DMA is implemented or claimed. Next kernel validation pending.

---

## Real IRQ regression passes; investigate I2C electrical idle lines

Run 37978335556 confirms real EL1 IRQ vector entry and ERET for both AIC
software IRQ0 and external I2C IRQ232; W1C deasserts without duplicates.
The original kernel still reports an I2C bad-bus assertion with otherwise
idle TX-empty status 0x00010000. Original I2C recovery inspects GPIO helpers
for SCL/SDA; the existing GPIO model sampled all undriven pins low.

Original gpio-iic_scl/sda tuples map I2C0 to pins 197/196, I2C1 to 40/39,
and I2C2 to 132/133 on the main bank. Model external pull-ups on these six
lines when released/input; output mode 1 preserves actively driven low/high.
Unrelated GPIOs and AOP pins are unchanged. ARM64 checks exercise all six
pins' idle, driven-low/high and input-release transitions. Bound extra
logging for these pins exposes the actual driver's recovery operations.
Next kernel validation pending. Pin data/mode layout reference:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/pinctrl/pinctrl-apple-gpio.c

---

## I2C empty-bus semantics pass; next PMP bank and real IRQ routing

Run 37977641862 passes I2C START/STOP/NACK/W1C/reset tests and advances
beyond the fabricated busy-status regression. The next data abort is
original PC 0xfffffff005dc4bac, physical 0x20e400000, /arm-io/pmp reg[2]
(64-KiB system control bank). Add this independently from PMP mailbox and
firmware SRAM. The original 32-bit control writes are retained without
manufacturing coprocessor ready state or firmware execution.

Separately, AIC events previously existed only in MMIO and did not drive
CPU IRQ. The research AIC now combines software and external level events,
updates CPU0 IRQ on mask/target/event changes, and auto-masks on event read.
The CPU receives the OR of the normal GIC and Apple AIC lines. I2C NACK/STOP
events drive original IRQs 232/233/234 when their interrupt masks and global
enable permit it; W1C deasserts the level. A genuine EL1 ARM64 regression
checks software IRQ0 and external I2C IRQ232, vector entry, acknowledgment,
ERET and absence of duplicate events. Timers retain their independent FIQ
route. New kernel validation remains pending; no launchd/SpringBoard claim.

---

## Replace I2C status latch with real empty-bus packet semantics

Run 37976778224 advances beyond the missing PCIe tuning assertion, then
I2C0 fails its bus-status check for display-pmu with status 0x0aa00040.
That is the driver's acknowledgment mask, incorrectly retained as status by
the discovery-only model. Original code and Linux i2c-pasemi-core agree:
+0 is MTXFIFO, +4 MRXFIFO, +0x14 SMSTA (W1C), +0x18 IMASK, +0x1c CTL.
START/STOP/READ commands use bits 8/9/10; status includes XIP bit28,
XEN bit27, MTN (NACK) bit21, MTE (TX-empty) bit16.

Model an empty bus: START has no responding slave and produces NACK;
STOP ends active transfer and records completion. RX remains empty, TX
commands are consumed, and derived active/empty state cannot be set by
acknowledgment writes. CTL FIFO-reset commands self-clear. Genuine ARM64
tests cover NACK, START/STOP, W1C, RX emptiness and reset. No successful
slave transaction or interrupt delivery is claimed; next kernel probe pending.

Reference: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-pasemi-core.c

---

## I2C passes; original PCIe configure requires an iBoot tuning property

Run 37976146675 passes I2C ARM64 initialization and advances to
AppleT8010PCIe::configure. Its original assertion requires an OSData property
named apcie-phy-tunables, absent from the IPSW /arm-io/apcie node. Original
code at 0xfffffff00694ed04 looks it up and casts it before storing +0x1d8.
The opt-in research virtual PHY declares an empty tuning list: no analog
hardware needs programming. Existing supplied tables are preserved and the
original metadata baseline is unchanged. No kernel assertion is patched,
no PHY-ready or PCI link-up state is manufactured. A real controller model
and subsequent kernel validation remain necessary. Tests cover opt-in,
platform validation and preservation of authentic supplied data.

---

## SPI regression passes; next original access reaches I2C initialization

Run 37975568120 passes SPI controls and advances the kernel to I2C1.
Original PC 0xfffffff00613c824 writes divider 4 to physical 0x20a11101c,
then timing 0x0aa00040 at +0x14, zero at +0x18, and 0x80000000 at +0x10.
Original DeviceTree defines three 4-KiB banks at 0x20a110000, 0x20a111000,
0x20a112000 (IRQs 232/233/234), compatible i2c,t8010/i2c,s5l8940x.
Provide independent discovery/control storage and a genuine ARM64 probe of
that sequence and each bank's boundary. Slave acknowledgments, bus packets,
FIFO side effects and IRQ completion are not yet implemented or claimed.
The original initialization routine does not poll a reset-complete bit at
this point. This is not a synthetic hardware-ready signal. Probe pending.

---

## Original SPI driver discovery/control apertures

Run 37974713532 data-aborts in Samsung SPI register write at physical
0x20a084000, original PC 0xfffffff005d77b84. The calling routine disables
+0 and +0xc, then writes its configuration at +8. DeviceTree has two
spi-1,samsung banks: SPI1 at 0x20a084000/0x4000 and SPI2 at
0x20a088000/0x4000, with IRQs 215/216. Provide separate zero-initialized
32-bit discovery/control storage. No codec/touch packets, SPI transfer
completion, FIFO contents or interrupts are fabricated. Genuine ARM64
checks execute the observed disable/configure sequence and verify bank
independence and end-of-window storage before another real kernel probe.

---

## Verified checkpoint: run 37974713532, next missing device is SPI1

The genuine ARM64 SEP/SIO/PMP checks pass in one machine: independent queue
state, boot-parameter controls, 64-bit sends, immutable derived status, and
PMP SRAM word/byte-order/end-boundary storage. Timer regression also passes.
Actual kernel execution progresses beyond the previously fatal PMP control
access. AppleSEPManager registers and AppleCredentialManager matches it.

The next real data abort occurs at original PC 0xfffffff005d77b84, instruction
word 0xb8214902, physical 0x20a084000. Original DeviceTree identifies
/arm-io/spi1 reg[0], a 16-KiB SPI control aperture. This controller is not yet
modeled; do not interpret the successful component tests as an iOS boot.
The restore launchd/EL0 regression gate correctly fails in this single-CPU
configuration. No SpringBoard, normal root-volume boot, or usable iOS IPA
is confirmed. Passive mailbox and SRAM support does not execute coprocessor
firmware or synthesize authentication/security responses.

Evidence: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/37974713532

---

## PMP SRAM accepts firmware; next access is its control bank

Run 37974361788 passes timer and mailbox/SRAM checks. Original RTBuddy
writes its PMP firmware and advances to AppleA7IOP's boot-parameter helper
at PC 0xfffffff005dc3760. The next data abort at physical 0x20e300018 maps
to /arm-io/pmp reg[0], 128 KiB at 0x20e300000. Map this independently from
firmware SRAM at reg[1]; the same observed AppleA7IOP control helper is
already exercised for SIO. The ARM64 queue-isolation test now executes SEP,
SIO and PMP in one machine before its SRAM check. Firmware execution and
real IOP responses remain unimplemented. Next original kernel result pending.

---

## PMP SRAM allocation ownership regression caught before kernel execution

Run 37973912011 fails the first timer test before any guest executes. QEMU
memory_region_init_ram requires a NULL or DeviceState owner for RAM migration
naming, while the new region supplied MachineState. The assertion accurately
identifies this initialization bug. Use NULL with the unique board RAM name;
QEMU registers the region globally. The existing timer and SRAM tests must
both pass before the next genuine kernel probe. No iOS boot claimed.

---

## PMP firmware loading reaches previously missing SRAM: run 37973299612

Both SEP/SIO ARM64 tests pass, including queue independence in the same
machine. The actual kernel advances to RTBuddy(PMP) and finds t8010pmp
firmware. Its copy loop at original PC 0xfffffff005dd7da4 data-aborts on the
first word at physical 0x20e500000. Original DeviceTree /arm-io/pmp reg[1]
is a 128-KiB firmware aperture. The observed word is ARM32 branch ea000018.

Map this window as zero-initialized RAM suitable for loading firmware,
rather than a control-register bank. ARM64 checks exercise the observed
word, byte order, wide storage, and the final 64-bit boundary. This does
not implement the PMP coprocessor, RTKit responses or firmware execution.
No launchd recovery or normal iOS desktop has been confirmed; next kernel
probe pending.

---

## Next reached IOP instance is SIO: run 37972738221

The SEP mailbox ARM64 test passes, but the actual kernel reaches a separate
AppleA7IOP instance for SmartIO and aborts at original PC 0xfffffff005dc3760,
physical 0x20ae00018. DeviceTree identifies /arm-io/sio, reg index 0,
64 KiB at 0x20ae00000. Original code writes boot configuration at +0x18,
+0x20, +0x28, +0x30, +8, +0x10 and +0x38. Add this distinct aperture to
the passive mailbox model; each bank has separate controls and queue state.
ARM64 checks now exercise both apertures and their boot-parameter writes.
The mailbox report is explicitly retained in Actions evidence. No IOP
firmware execution or success responses are claimed. Next probe pending.

## SEP manager registers; next original fault reaches its IOP mailbox

Run 37972077876 passes chip-id initialization: AppleSEPManager reports
control endpoints created, PM init done, registered, and starts power state
0 -> 2. The next data abort is str w10 at original PC 0xfffffff005dc3544,
physical 0x20da04000, inside /arm-io/sep's 64-KiB aperture. The adjacent
original code writes 0x1111 at +0x4000/+0xc00. Original mailbox helpers use
empty/full bits 17/16 at +0x4008/+0x4020 and 64-bit words +0x4010/+0x4038.

The new research device models control storage and a bounded single-slot
AP-to-SEP queue. Without a SEP peer, one sent message remains pending/full;
the receive queue stays empty. Guest writes cannot manufacture responses
or clear derived queue status. No SEP firmware, keys, DMA or completion IRQs
are emulated. Genuine ARM64 checks exercise wide message transactions and
queue invariants before another kernel probe. Kernel validation is pending;
launchd has not recovered in the single-CPU configuration, no SpringBoard.

---

## Original error-handler startup passes; next fatal check is SEP chip type

Run 37971329013 passes the ARM64 status-acknowledgment regression and the
original error-handler no longer data-aborts. The kernel reaches
AppleSEPManager and panics in SEPROMPanicBuffer because /chosen/chip-id is
still the four-byte all-zero iBoot placeholder. Original code looks up
/chosen, requires four bytes, reads chip-id, and asserts it is nonzero.
The opt-in research handoff initializes exactly that placeholder to 0x8010,
verified against original arm-io,t8010 compatibility. Nonzero supplied
values and unique-chip-id remain untouched. No working SEP, ECID, nonce or
security state is fabricated. Next kernel validation remains pending.

Fault diagnostics now decode bounded file-backed instruction windows with
the existing Capstone dependency instead of unavailable Xcode llvm-mc.
Replaying run 37938836505's real panic decodes the original faulting
str w10, [x8, x9] at 0xfffffff006d0792c correctly.

---

## Error-handler acknowledgment regression caught before kernel execution

Run 37940003866 failed the genuine ARM64 MMIO check: writing all ones to
+0x10008 read back all ones. The generated handler retained the generic
control latch because its replacement targeted a nonexistent `s` variable
rather than `bank`. The replacement now uses the actual store and requires
exactly one source match, so generation fails if that anchor changes.
The existing ARM64 check covers the faulty behavior directly. A new kernel
run is required; neither launchd recovery nor iOS desktop is yet confirmed.

---

## Single-CPU topology releases AIC's CPU registration: run 37938836505

With cpus=1 the original AIC registerInterrupt for source 0 returns success
at 0xfffffff0068fcb98. Its unused source 1 returns a resource/index error and
the startup continues. The new actual fault is a 32-bit store at physical
0x200d10008, inside /arm-io/error-handler's third register window. It is not
a CLPC window. Restore userland regressed because this newly reached device
was absent; the CI launchd gate correctly fails instead of claiming boot.

The next model provides the five missing error-handler apertures at
0x200d00000/0x13000 and 0x200d20000, 0x200d90000, 0x200e20000,
0x200e90000 (each 0x1000). Only the observed status acknowledgment at +0x10008
is write-one-to-clear; other words are discovery/control backing stores.
The first two original windows already fall inside MCC and are not remapped.
No synthetic faults, full fabric-error handling or error IRQs are claimed.
A genuine ARM64 regression checks the exact faulting acknowledgment and
first/last control words of every added bank. Kernel validation is pending.

Separately, run 37938174593 confirms NVRAM preservation across two actual
kernel starts: second handoff selects bank 1 generation 3, guest userland
runs again, and backing banks finish at generations 5 and 4 with valid
checksums and the guest restore-outcome variable present. No SpringBoard.

---

## Match XNU CPU topology to the single realized QEMU CPU

Original IOCPUInterruptController::registerInterrupt waits while enabledCPUs
is different from numCPUs. The trace confirms entry to registerInterrupt and
enableCPUInterrupt, but AIC's first CPU-source registration does not return.
The harness realizes one CPU (-smp 1), while original DeviceTree describes
multiple CPUs. XNU ml_parse_cpu_topology accepts the supported cpus=N boot
argument and excludes additional CPU nodes. All single-CPU probe boot args
now include cpus=1. No original interrupt wait/check is patched out, and no
CPU enable state is fabricated. Actual AIC registration remains pending.

## Guest NVRAM writes now persist: run 37936769787

Original AppleARMCHRPNVRAM now writes both banks successfully. Host backing
bank 0 has generation 2 and bank 1 generation 3; both Adler-32 checks pass
and both contain the guest restore-outcome variable. No raw variables or
backing key material are exported. Restore userland remains confirmed with
17,107 EL0 returns. These are research NOR banks, not real n112ap NVMe.

The two diagnosed CFI faults are fixed: AMD unlock/unlock/query now enters
query mode (the former zero erase geometry caused kIOReturnNotAligned), and
64-bit reads after query are split into supported 32-bit callbacks (the
former access-size rejection caused a genuine XNU memcpy data abort).
The immediate-program virtual NOR advertises a matching 1-us byte program
time; original Apple driver code and alignment checks are retained.

On the next launch the research handoff selects the newest checksum-valid
saved bank, including UInt32 generation wrap handling, and restores its
proxy bytes. It never resets an image whose two banks are corrupt. A second
actual kernel start is now part of CI; its result is pending.

AES startup remains blocked because original AIC startup calls provider
registerInterrupt for CPU source 0 at PC 0xfffffff0068fcb94 and never records
its return at 0xfffffff0068fcb98. Only IOPlatformInterruptController registers;
IOInterruptController00000018 (AIC) is requested but never registered.
Therefore the next genuine panic remains missing IOAESAccelerator after
90 seconds. No successful AES operations or SpringBoard boot are claimed.

---

## Original NVRAM driver registers: run 37926905157

The separate CFI experiment now executes original AppleARMCHRPNVRAM startup:
`bank size=0x2000, bank count=0x2, current bank=0`. Actual controller
registerService at 0xfffffff0077bfe10 is translated, and restored reports
`NVRAM access available on initial check`. IOResources/IONVRAM waits disappear.
The guest sets and reads restore-outcome in its NVRAM service.

Persistent synchronization is NOT yet successful: original CHRP sync returns
0xe00002d0 (kIOReturnNotAligned), before CFI programming. The next trace captures
the original CFI write alignment check at 0xfffffff005b898e4, including real
length, offset, erase geometry and mask. No alignment check is removed.
The assembler guest CFI QRY/program/persistent-byte regression passed.

Userland remains real: 17,099 EL1-to-EL0 returns and launchd early boot markers.
The next explicit kernel panic is `cannot find IOAESAccelerator: timeout = 90
seconds`. This is another missing service/device dependency; the existing
minimal AES register-window model is not a working IOAESAccelerator.
No SpringBoard or regular iOS system-volume boot is claimed. CFI NOR remains
an opt-in alternative research provider, not the original n112ap NVMe board.

---

## Separate synthetic NOR NVRAM experiment

Original AppleARMPlatform.kext contains AppleARMCFIFlashController matching
nor-flash,cfi on AppleARMIODevice, and AppleARMCHRPNVRAM matching nvram,chrp
on AppleARMNORFlashDevice. Disassembly confirms #device-bytes/#port-devices
properties, 8-byte (UInt32 offset/length) child reg tuples, and an AMD CFI
query at command address 0x5555. This provides an alternative research
provider; it does not reproduce the n112ap NVMe NVRAM hardware.

The new opt-in --research-cfi-nvram probe adds a 32-KiB NOR device at synthetic
physical 0x2f0000000, using the original arm-io address range. It passes two
8-KiB CHRP banks to the original driver and supplies a writable raw backing
file. Standard probes do not get the controller. Existing backing contents
are retained. QEMU's CFI02 implementation handles query, programming and
erase; its query address check additionally accepts the configured AMD
unlock address used by the Apple driver. No forced IONVRAM publication or
Apple driver/kernel instruction modification is added by this experiment.

An assembler-built ARM64 regression checks QRY, programming and the changed
byte in the host backing file. The separate real-kernel probe is pending;
driver registration, guest variable writes and reboot persistence are not
yet claimed. 48 local Python tests pass.

The native application's fixed 16-GiB sparse backing file passes macOS Swift
tests, including holes, boundary rejection, existing-image preservation,
and persistent writes above 4 GiB. iPhone app build run 37926551859 passed.
This backing file is not yet connected to a guest NVMe controller.

## NVRAM proxy tested: run 37922572838

The zero-placeholder replacement is active on the real n112ap DeviceTree.
Restore launchd/userland still execute: 12,989 EL1-to-EL0 returns and all
three launchd markers (hello, restore environment, early boot complete).
No SpringBoard or regular system-volume boot is confirmed.

IONVRAM resource waits remain. Original IOPlatformExpert::publishNVRAM at
0xfffffff007780ddc is translated; neither IONVRAMController::registerService
at 0xfffffff0077bfe10 nor IOPlatformExpert::registerNVRAMController at
0xfffffff00777f8dc appears in the execution trace. Source publishes the
IONVRAM resource on controller registration, not proxy initialization.
Thus the proxy does not solve the missing controller. No forced resource
publication or fabricated security variables are used.

Restored services also report no enumerated IOMobileFramebuffer display,
and restored_external exits after disable_watchdog fails. These are separate
remaining hardware/service dependencies. The original-kernel comparison
still does not reach EL0 within its 30-second bound.

A CI regression gate now independently reads serial and execution traces:
actual restore launchd and EL0 execution are required. Mere successful QEMU
exit, a load attempt, or compiler success cannot pass this gate. Modified
kernel provenance and absence of a desktop-boot claim are mandatory.
47 local tests pass; the gate passes on both downloaded genuine traces.

---

## Confirmed restore userland: run 37840981874

The GPU startup command-completion fix passed its genuine guest regression.
The explicit modified-root experiment now executes actual Apple userland:
launchd prints `hello`, `Restore environment starting`, and `Early boot complete`.
The QEMU trace contains 13,025 EL1-to-EL0 returns, beginning at 0x104f81170.
Restore services including restored_extern run. The official restore trust
cache permits this execution with AMFI validation enabled.

This is the restore ramdisk environment, not SpringBoard, the regular system
volume, or a usable IPA. The IOSecureBSDRoot experiment remains explicitly
modified; the original kernel comparison remains separate.

The next observed dependency is repeated IOResources/IONVRAM waiting.
Original /chosen contains all-zero iBoot placeholders for nvram-bank-size
and the 8-KiB nvram-proxy-data. XNU's
IODTNVRAM::init requires the former; start parses the latter. The research
handoff now supplies an empty 8-KiB CHRP v1 bank with checked header sums,
Adler-32, and empty common/system partitions. Nonzero existing handoff bytes are
preserved; only absent properties or the exact zero-placeholder pair are initialized. This is volatile proxy initialization only: no persistent NVRAM
controller, nonce seeds, security-variable fabrication, or forced resource
publication is included. Actual service availability needs the next run.

The probe now records separate evidence fields for EL0 returns, launchd hello,
restore environment, and NVRAM waits. It never labels these as desktop boot.

## SGX/GFX command-completion stall: run 37839672173

The restore probes now receive the official trust-cache region. No userland
entry is yet confirmed: the modified-root probe ran for 120 seconds in
original GPU startup code at PC 0xfffffff005fd2460. That code writes 0x11 at
0x201d01000 and polls bit 4 until it clears. The backing model kept 0x11
forever. The next change completes that command by clearing only bit 4,
retaining bit 0 and other fields, with a genuine guest regression. This is
startup command semantics, not GPU rendering or command-stream emulation.
AMFI acceptance of launchd remains unconfirmed until the next actual load.

---

## Actual launchd load attempt: run 37836967932

The explicit modified-kernel restore experiment progresses beyond the root
security gate and attempts to load /sbin/launchd. Original AMFI rejects its
adhoc signature with unsuitable CT policy 0; init receives SIGKILL. This is
an execution/load attempt, not confirmed launchd userland entry.

The official n112ap erase BuildManifest supplies RestoreTrustCache at
Firmware/098-68700-067.dmg.trustcache. Its rtsc IM4P contains a v1 module with
233 entries (including one valid identical duplicate), UUID
d0516b3d23844c8f9edd1d3bcfe65fca. No hashes, hash types or flags are changed.
XNU osfmk/arm/trustcache.c expects a serialized module-count/offset region.
The next probe passes it through /chosen/memory-map/TrustCache, at physical
0x454e0000 immediately below the first kernel segment, in a 16-KiB region.
The modeled MCC read-only range now includes that page. ELF regions were
verified non-overlapping. Both original and explicitly modified root probes
receive the official cache; AMFI validation remains enabled. Guest acceptance
is pending. 41 local Python tests pass.

## Confirmed post-mount block: run 37834592824

Original HFS root mounting repeats successfully. Runtime tracing reaches
IOSecureBSDRoot entry and the SecureRootName platform dispatch, but never
records its return within 120 seconds. This isolates the next dependency.

An explicitly separate restore-userland experiment now accepts
--research-ramdisk-root. It changes only the IOSecureBSDRoot entry instruction
in the generated ELF to RET. The original kernel file is untouched. The edit
requires exact kernel SHA-256 115489dd3e2adbe3e0d646413adb9397cfaf1c47f7b5d03620f78dd7d9371814
and a matching 24-byte function signature; other kernels are rejected.
Both hashes and the exact edit are recorded in guest-patches.json. This is an
unauthenticated, modified-kernel research test to isolate userland startup,
not a completed virtual secure-boot implementation or an ordinary iOS desktop.
The unpatched restore test remains separate. No launchd execution is yet
confirmed. Local patch guards/regressions pass (37 Python tests total).

---

## Genuine root filesystem mount: run 37832777803

After the MCA reset-completion fix, original XNU selects md0 and prints:
`hfs: mounted SkyUpdate19H422.arm64CustomerRamDisk on device b(3, 0)`.
This confirms the real Apple restore HFSX root volume mounted in the guest.
The 120-second run captured no panic. It does not confirm launchd or a home
screen; restore userland is distinct from an ordinary iOS desktop.

Next diagnostics trace the actual IOSecureBSDRoot entry and its SecureRootName
platform call/return at 0xfffffff0077b9084/0xfffffff0077b9108/0xfffffff0077b910c.
The original Apple source calls this immediately after mountroot. The helper
only logs registers and never changes guest instructions or return values.
The goal is to distinguish security/resource waiting from userland execution
failure, using actual runtime evidence. The backend is still external to IPA.

---

## Two minutes without panic; MCA reset stall: run 37831773255

The genuine PMGR boundary setter now receives count 4, P-core-lowest 2.
The former P-core assertion is resolved. CPU debug-map accesses also proceed.
The restore probe runs for its full 120-second budget without a captured
panic, but it does not confirm root mounting or userland.

Actual CPU PC=0xfffffff0071c0a20 is a delay routine, with LR=0xfffffff00657c730.
The original MCA reset routine writes bits 0/1 at offset 0xc, then polls each
until it clears. The register backing retained bit 0 indefinitely, as proven
by repeated reads at 0x20a0ac00c. The next model completes those reset commands
immediately while preserving other fields. A guest test covers both commands
on all three banks. It still provides no PCM, DMA or MCA interrupt delivery.

---

## CPU group ordering and debug-map diagnosis: run 37830662740

The P-core boundary setter still received zero with ascending E/P frequencies.
Original generic PMGR at 0xfffffff0066e0018 detects a group boundary when the
frequency decreases. The revised research table therefore uses 396/1092 MHz
E states followed by 756/1644 MHz P states, directly from the original static
VFC endpoints. The single drop occurs at index 2. Nominal virtual voltage
metadata is 900 so the kernel's V-squared power calculation is nonzero; it is
not a recovered iBoot voltage or simulated physical rail. ACC records 2/3
are classified P; records 0/1 are E.

The actual next fault was a kernel debug-map store of the CoreSight access
key 0xc5acce55 at 0x202010fb0 (PC 0xfffffff0072dc118). Four original CLPC
register ranges at 0x202010000/0x202030000/0x202110000/0x202130000, each 64 KiB,
are now backed for bootstrap with a guest access/boundary test. This does not
emulate CPU debug or profiling machinery. Out-of-RAM translation diagnostics
now also cover static kernel VAs, which the former heap-only filter missed.
Kernel validation of these changes is pending; root/userland are unconfirmed.

---

## Verified SGX/GFX mapping progress: run 37829444239

SGX/GFX bank checks pass and the former GPU-control store fault is gone.
The next original-kernel assertion is _statePcoreLowest > 0 at
AppleT8010PMGR.cpp:602. A single synthetic state is insufficient to express
both efficiency and performance classes. The next explicit research handoff
uses two nominal states: 396 MHz from the original ecore-static-vvfc, and
1644 MHz from mcx-fast-cpu-frequency. Their period encodings remain type-1
PMGR periods. The modeled ACC state records classify state 0 as E and state 1
as P using bit 23, which the original method reads at 0xfffffff006943678.

This is synthetic nominal metadata and immediate transitions, not recovered
iBoot voltages or physical DVFS. Nonzero original tables remain untouched.
Runtime tracing also captures the P-core boundary setter arguments so the
next kernel run can verify its actual result. Root/userland are unconfirmed.

---

## Verified MIPI-DSIM progress: run 37828651313

The MIPI-DSIM range guest test passes and XNU progresses past its initial
read. The next failure is a 32-bit store of 0x11 to 0x201d01000, PC
0xfffffff005fd2458. Original sgx and gfx-kf nodes share the 128-KiB physical
range at 0x201d00000. The next model creates that bank once, plus their
separate 1-MiB SGX and 64-KiB GFX-KF banks. Guest checks cover the observed
store, bank independence and boundaries. This is register backing only, not
GPU command execution, rendering, DMA or GPU interrupt emulation.
Boot to root/userland/desktop remains unconfirmed.

---

## Verified MCA progress: run 37827850041

All three MCA banks and reset-register guest checks pass. XNU moves on to a
read fault at physical 0x206600000, PC 0xfffffff0065dc9cc. The original tree
identifies mipi-dsim reg[0], size 1 MiB. The next backing model covers that
exact range with dynamically sized storage and a real ARM64 guest test of
initial reads, independent registers and the final register. Panel signaling,
PLL timing and display output are not implemented by these latches. Boot
remains incomplete; root mounting, launchd and SpringBoard are not confirmed.

---

## Verified DWI progress: run 37827170433

The DWI initialization/boundary guest test passes. XNU reaches a new 32-bit
store fault at physical 0x20a002008, PC 0xfffffff00657ab2c. The original tree
identifies this as mca2 reg[1], a four-byte reset register. The next model
covers the three original MCA banks (mca0/mca2/mca3, 16 KiB each) and their
individual four-byte reset registers, with a guest test of all bank boundaries
and reset/clear accesses. Register storage only: PCM, DMA, codecs and MCA IRQs
remain unimplemented. No root mount or userspace is confirmed.

---

## Verified USB-complex progress: run 37826471006

The USB-complex parent control test passes and XNU proceeds past its control
write. The next fault is a 32-bit write at physical 0x20e200000 from PC
0xfffffff006507514. The original DeviceTree identifies dwi,t8010/dwi,s8000,
IRQ 5, with a 16-KiB register range. The observed initialization writes offsets
0, 0xd0, 4, 0x84 and 0x80. A separate DWI backing-store model and ARM64 guest
initialization/boundary test are added next. DWI bus transfers and IRQ delivery
are unimplemented; no root mount, launchd or SpringBoard is confirmed.

---

## Verified ACC page progress: run 37825946490

The observed ACC control page test passes and XNU progresses past its former
store fault. The next failure is a 32-bit write of 0x108 at physical
0x20c90001c, PC 0xfffffff006d0f600. This resolves to the original DeviceTree's
usb-complex parent control range, base 0x20c900000, size 0xa0. The next patch
adds that exact range using independent backing registers and a guest test
of the observed write and last register. USB host/device signaling, DMA and
interrupt delivery are still not implemented. No root mount or userland is
confirmed.

---

## Verified CPU performance fix: run 37825327929

The real guest CPU performance tests pass. The original kernel no longer
panics on readACCReg64 with state 254. The next captured fault is a 64-bit
store at PC 0xfffffff006ce380c to physical 0x202f38008, value 0x8033.
Its saved registers show the driver mapping [0x202f38000,0x202f39000).
This page is not in the PMGR DeviceTree reg list. The next model provides
backing control latches for that observed page and a 64-bit guest test.
No extra PLL/timing semantics are claimed. Root mounting and userland remain
unconfirmed, and the research backend remains external to the IPA.

---

## ACC assertion diagnosis from run 37824318487

Runtime argument tracing captured readACCReg64(0x00f82000), originating from
CPU state 254. The original driver at 0xfffffff006944a18 reads the low nibble
of ACC 0x00f20020, subtracts 2, and masks to 8 bits. The raw backing store
returned 0x61002000 with low nibble zero, producing the invalid state 254.
The physical register is 0x202f20020. This is not a missing MMIO aperture.

The next virtual CPU performance model starts at encoded state 2, preserves
completed state during control initialization, processes UPDATE bit 25, and
clears BUSY bit 31 immediately. It does not simulate physical DVFS/PLL timing.
The guest regression test covers reset state, initialization, requested state,
BUSY clearing and invalid-zero protection. Kernel validation is pending.

---

## Verified FIQ progress: run 37816744771

Physical and virtual timer FIQ delivery passed the real guest test. Original
XNU then progressed beyond the scheduler stall and stopped at a new assertion:
AppleT8010PMGR::readACCReg64(UInt32):1195 REQUIRE failed: 0. This is not a full
iOS boot. The next diagnostic captures the guest stack to recover the ACC read
argument and its caller. Root mounting, launchd and SpringBoard are unconfirmed.

---

## Timer interrupt diagnosis after the extended probe

Run 37815576973 completed the genuine 120-second restore experiment. It did
not mount a confirmed root volume or start userland. CPU snapshots from both
30-second and 120-second probes show PC=0xfffffff0071f1884 in the scheduler,
not the former PMGR polling loop. Generic timers were still routed through
virt's GIC, whereas Apple timer delivery uses FIQ. This is the next suspected
cause, not a confirmed fix yet.

The next research backend routes the physical and virtual EL1 timer outputs
through a level-preserving OR to CPU FIQ and disconnects the unused GIC FIQ
output for this CPU only. A genuine guest must receive each timer at the FIQ
vector, observe ISTATUS, disable the timer, and resume with ERET. The kernel
probe follows that test. External device IRQ wiring and Apple EL2 timer-enable
controls remain unimplemented.

## Latest verified run: 37814842447

The PMGR 64-bit aperture fault and the polling loop at 0x20e080230 are
resolved in the external research backend. Genuine guest tests pass. The
unpatched kernel reaches display, I2C, PCIe and AVE driver startup, with and
without the official restore ramdisk. Both experiments reach the 30-second
execution budget without a captured panic. This is not proof of a mounted
root volume, launchd or SpringBoard: none is confirmed.

The next probe extends the restore experiment to 120 seconds and captures
actual stopped CPU registers using local QMP, rather than inferring the
stopped PC from the last translated block. iOS is not yet booted to its home
screen and the backend is not yet part of the IPA.

---

## October 8, 2026: no iOS desktop confirmed

The external QEMU v10 research backend executes the original iPod9,1
kernelcache (iOS 15.8.8, 19H422). It is not yet integrated in the IPA.
The unchanged DeviceTree stops at ApplePMGR.cpp:1148 because iBoot bridge
settings are absent. The separate opt-in experiment supplies explicitly
synthetic bridge tuning lists and fixed clocks, not recovered iBoot settings.

That experiment passed CPU0, PLL and MCX performance-state checks. The last
completed run, 37809829401, faulted on a 64-bit read at 0x202f80040, PMGR reg[6].
The next change adds the remaining control apertures and 64-bit accesses,
with a genuine guest test. Run 37810433515 was still queued when recorded;
the kernel execution of that fix is not yet confirmed.

The probe now accepts --ramdisk for the official IPSW's raw HFSX restore disk.
It supplies /chosen/memory-map/RAMDisk and rd=md0, reserving the image below
boot_args.topOfKernelData. Local construction of the ELF was verified with
113845760 image bytes at 0x47dfc000, reserved top 0x4ea90000. Host validation
is not a successful guest mount. CI keeps the ramdisk experiment separate.

32 local Python tests pass. A green bootstrap workflow means the next fault
was captured and register tests passed, not that iOS booted. Mounting md0,
launchd and SpringBoard remain unconfirmed. Restore userland would also be

# Состояние запуска iOS

Цель: загрузить iOS на модели iPod touch 7 / T8010 / n112ap. Цель пока не достигнута: корневой том, launchd и SpringBoard ещё не подтверждены. Настоящий вывод XNU уже получен через UART.

## Обновление 7 октября 2026

Первые сообщения настоящего XNU теперь получены через UART: оригинальное ядро выводит `arm_init: Unable to find 'dram-base' entry in the 'chosen' DT node`. Это ранняя panic, не успешная загрузка iOS. [Подтверждённый запуск](https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/37646951870), исходный вывод: [evidence/xnu-uart-first.txt](../evidence/xnu-uart-first.txt).

Пройдены прежние остановки на APRR/HID и PMU bootstrap. Исправлены выравнивание виртуальной базы с нижними prelinked-сегментами, iBoot placeholder-флаги длин свойств device tree, частоты timebase/fixed-frequency и 64-байтовый seed загрузчика. В отдельной гостевой программе подтверждены регистры и UART TX. Связанные с контролем производительности регистры пока представлены latch-моделью, без полной логики счётчиков/прерываний; APRR ещё не применяет разрешения к MMU.

Добавлены dram-base/dram-size, соответствующие фактическому RAM машины QEMU virt. [Проверка](https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/37647482992) прошла прежнюю panic и не зафиксировала исключений CPU до ограничения трассы. Это не подтверждение полной загрузки. Это исследовательский внешний backend на Mac, ещё не модель полного iPod7 внутри IPA.

В iPhone-приложение добавлены StikDebug universal protocol и настоящий JIT блоков арифметики; проверка готовности выполняет сгенерированную ARM64-функцию. [Инструкция и ограничения](JIT.md). На физическом iPhone интеграция пока не проверена.

Далее сохранена история первоначального исследования; её ранние ограничения не описывают весь нынешний прогресс.

## Что подтверждено 6 октября 2026

- Прошивка Apple: iPod9,1, iOS 15.8.8, build 19H422. Загрузочные компоненты выбраны по BuildManifest, а не по догадкам о названиях.
- IM4P/LZFSE и ARM64-срез kernelcache распакованы; Mach-O segments и LC_UNIXTHREAD обработаны. Device tree имеет 190 узлов и `arm-io,t8010`.
- Swift CPU выполнил 38 исходных инструкций kernelcache, включая реальную проверку пары инструкций pinst и установку VBAR. Затем остановился на неизвестном MSR.
- В отдельном эксперименте QEMU 11.1.1 выполнил загрузочный stub, переход на исходную точку входа ядра, OSLAR/DAIF и pinst. Затем возникло Undefined Instruction на `S3_4_C15_C2_1` (`0xd51cf220`), и гостевая система перешла в ранний exception-vector loop.
- Пройдено 20 Swift-тестов, восемь Python-тестов и проверка десяти opcode fixtures ассемблером Apple. Эти проверки не являются проверкой загрузки iOS.

Первая проверка оригинальной прошивки и трассы: https://github.com/agent-ios-dev/Podium7/actions/runs/37517496146

В исследовательском QEMU запуске физический entry — `0x43cac4e8`, адрес операции отказа — `0x44338030`; это релокация на синтетическую плату virt, не карта физической памяти настоящего A10. Аргументы загрузки соответствуют структуре iOS 15 с CommandLine 608 байт и bootFlags по смещению 720. Отчёт содержит `kernel_entry_seen: true` и `booted_ios: false`.

## Что требуется дальше

1. Подтвердить и реализовать семантику Apple-регистров, начиная с S3_4_C15_C2_1. Нельзя считать хранение записанного значения полной реализацией защиты памяти.
2. Выбрать окончательный CPU/MMU-бэкенд и реализовать модель T8010 вместо virt. Исследовательский QEMU сейчас запускается внешним процессом на Mac; для IPA нужен отдельный перенос.
3. Реальная физическая карта, таймеры, прерывания, UART и корректная передача boot args/device tree. Первые строки UART должны происходить от гостевого XNU.
4. Накопитель и загрузка корневого тома, необходимые драйверы устройств, пользовательское окружение и SpringBoard.

Нельзя выводить успешную загрузку из успешной компиляции, ненулевого счётчика инструкций или зелёного статуса workflow анализа.
